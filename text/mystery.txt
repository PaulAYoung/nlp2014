SINGAPORE OIL COMPANIES TO SET OWN PUMP PRICES
  Singapore oil companies can set their
  own petrol and diesel prices at the pump from today subject to
  ceilings determined by their individual wholesale prices, The
  Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
      The ministry previously revised pump prices and announced
  the changes for the oil companies.
      Lead content of petrol is further cut to 0.15 gm/litre from
  0.4 gm from today. Pump prices of the lower lead petrol grades
  are expected to be announced soon by the oil companies which
  have said wholesale prices are between 1.3 cents/litre to 3.2
  cents higher than previous grades.
  

BANGLADESH TO IMPORT 60,000 TONS OF DIESEL FROM USSR
  Bangladesh will import 60,000 tons of high
  speed diesel oil from the Soviet Union under a barter agreement
  signed here last week, Bangladesh petroleum Corporation

      The oil worth about 10 mln U.S. Dlrs will be shipped by
  December this year, they added but did not say what Bangladesh
  would sell in return to the Soviet Union.
  

FUEL STORAGE TANKS IN FRANCE BURST INTO FLAMES
  Two people were missing and six
  injured after tanks containing thousands of cubic metres of
  fuel burst into flames today at a Shell storage unit in Lyon,
  rescue workers said.
      The blaze broke out with an explosion around 1330 local
  time (1130 GMT). Shell is a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group &lt;RD>.
      Some 200 firemen fought the flames at the gasoline storage
  unit at Edouard Herriot riverside port complex and appeared to
  have the blaze under control as night fell. The entire southern
  section of Lyon was cordoned off.
      The fire destroyed five giant tanks and threatened four
  others, the Shell spokesman said. He said that the company
  estimated between six and seven thousand cubic metres of
  domestic fuel oil, gasoline and additives had been burned.
      The total capacity of the burning tanks was over 10,000
  cubic metres, but some had been empty when an explosion started
  today's fire, he added.

TANZANIA RAISES FUEL PRICES,TAXES IN 1987/8 BUDGET
  The Tanzanian government, in its
  second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery
  program inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced
  increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on
  government services.
      Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected
  to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8,
  39 pct more than this year's estimate. Revenue would provide
  48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to
  be financed through domestic and foreign loans.
      This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only
  3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to
  impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No
  figure for the final deficit was avaialble.
      The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with
  effect from July 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30
  pct.
      Msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar
  increases in the cost of premium and kerosene. Diesel would
  rise by 75 pct.
      The higher levies affect official transactions such as road
  tolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.

OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD
  OPEC has shown itself to be in control
  of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
  pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
  (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
      They said market respect for the cartel has increased since
  it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
  to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.
      "There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured
  there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
  effect putting pressure on end-users," a European crude oil
  trader said.
      In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, "There's no reason to expect
  a weak market from now on."
      A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, "We
  thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
  production so the market will react very bullishly."
      Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a
  slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark
  crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
      August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
  around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
  below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.
      Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu
  Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
  positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders
  said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.
      They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
  stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.
      They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected
  and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
  requirements before October.
      Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
  European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.
      "There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
  by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high," said an
  international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less
  bullish, "For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
  how much they (OPEC members) cheat."
      A Singapore trade source said, "There is enough cheating and
  leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is
  no need to worry about shortages."
      Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,
  after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
  factor to be considered.
      Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
  possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
  cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.
      Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in
  thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates
  quiet on minimal buying interest.
      Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and
  tight prompt supplies, dealers said.

ECUADOR ADOPTS AUSTERITY MEASURES AFTER QUAKE
  OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity
  measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by
  a strong earthquake.
      Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on
  television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct.
  A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite
  suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.
      Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a
  television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a
  month to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basin
  oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.
      The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point
  Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near
  the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.
      Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.
      The government's austerity measures ban the sale of
  aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and
  no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines.
      Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and
  holidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and Mines
  Ministry communique said.
  

RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 1.9 PCT FROM YEAR AGO
  U.S. oil demand as measured by
  products supplied rose 1.9 pct in the four weeks ended March
  six to 16.39 mln barrels per day from 16.08 mln in the same
  period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
  said.
      In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy
  Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.2 pct in
  the period to 3.33 mln bpd from 3.40 mln a year earlier.
      Gasoline demand averaged 6.75 mln bpd, up 3.3 pct from 6.53
  mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.40 mln bpd, off
  2.7 pct from 1.43 mln, the EIA said.
      Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln
  bpd, down 8.5 pct from 9.15 mln a year ago, and gross daily
  crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.67 mln
  bpd, up 23 pct from 2.97 mln, the EIA said.
      Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.05 mln bpd,
  up 1.5 pct from 11.87 mln a year earlier, it said.
      Year-to-date figures will not become available until March
  26 when EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987
  becomes available, the agency said.
  

PACIFIC RESOURCES &lt;PRI> INSTALLS OIL MOORING
  Pacific Resources Inc said it has
  installed a CALM (Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring) single-point
  mooring terminal off the southwest coast of Oahu at its
  Hawaiian Independent Refinery at a cost of 3.5 mln dlrs.
      The system transfers crude and fuel oils from tankers to
  the refinery's tank farm and carries refined products to ships
  for export, PRI said.
      Company chairman Robert G. Reed said the new mooring system
  will permit 24-hour service in most kinds of weather and will
  reduce ship turnaround time. He said the mooring is the first
  of its kind in the U.S.
      The new system can accomodate vessels up to 150,000
  deadweight tons, or one mln barrels of cargo, PRI said.
  

SENATE COMMITTEE MAY LOOK AT FUEL TAX PROPOSALS
  The Senate budget committee sits
  down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the
  budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel
  taxes and other tax options to cut the budget.
      In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of
  revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs
  a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on
  imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy
  consumption based on five pct of value.
      Other proposals include various excise taxes and
  combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10
  pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise
  22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.
      The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers
  in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left
  to the House and Senate tax-writing committees.
       The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen
  Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at
  least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36
  billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.
      The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a
  separate budget plan later this week, which would have to be
  reconciled with the Senate version. The final budget would be
  the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint.

CALTEX RAISES SINGAPORE OIL PRODUCT PRICES
  Caltex Petroleum Corp, a joint venture
  between Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, said it raised
  posted prices for several petroleum products in Singapore,
  effective today.
       The company said its naphtha posting is up three cts a
  gallon to 43 cts. It said it is raising jet and kerosene
  postings 2.5 cts, bringing jet to 52.5 cts and kerosene to 51.5
  cts.
      Diesel grades are up two cts, Caltex said, bringing both
  diesel gas oil (one pct sulfur) and 52-57 D.I. (55 cetane) to
  52 cts a gallon, and diesel gas oil (0.5 pct) to 52 cts.
      The company said it is increasing medium and heavy fuel oil
  postings by one dlr a barrel. Medium is now 15.50 dlrs a
  barrel, and heavy fuel is 14.75 dlrs.
  

NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE
  Higher crude oil prices will raise
  demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost
  to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.
      The analysts said that these efforts will be most
  successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large
  and growing energy requirements.
      "Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of
  oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual
  fuel industry last year," Michael Smolinski, an energy
  economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.
      An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went
  into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last
  year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said. 
      Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national
  average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected
  2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,
  Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American
  Gas Association said.
      The average delivered prices at the end of January were
  2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.
      "We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic
  feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and
  third quarter (1987)," he said.
      In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be
  an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,
  Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.
  in New York noted.
      Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North
  American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and
  less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this
  spring freeing gas for spot sales.
      These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears
  that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices
  significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last
  year.
      AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline,
  much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production
  quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which
  permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.
      Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus
  was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986
  to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not
  go away until 1990.
      Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would
  persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain
  consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast
  U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.
  

FINNS AND CANADIANS TO STUDY MTBE PRODUCTION PLANT
  Finland's national oil company Neste Oy
  &lt;NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms
  to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,
  Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.
      The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln
  Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether
  (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.
      The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada
  Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line
  Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.
      The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials
  availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the
  important capital and operating advantages gained by locating
  on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.
      The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant
  producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer
  that can replace tetra ethyl lead.
      Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States
  where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of
  health concerns, the statement added.
      Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the
  U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in
  Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,
  it said.
      Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five
  billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a
  major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.
      The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on
  stream in late 1989, the statement said.

  marketing of its mid-grade unleaded gasoline along the U.S.
  East Coast.
      The Exxon Corp subsidiary said the changeover to the
  89-octane unleaded fuel will begin late this month and early
  next in major markets in Virginia, Maryland, Florida, and the
  District of Columbia. The product was introduced in New York,
  New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,
  New Hampshire and the Philadelphia area late last year.
  

SINGAPORE OIL COMPANIES TO SET OWN PUMP PRICES
  Singapore oil companies can set their
  own petrol and diesel prices at the pump from today subject to
  ceilings determined by their individual wholesale prices, The
  Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
      The ministry previously revised pump prices and announced
  the changes for the oil companies.
      Lead content of petrol is further cut to 0.15 gm/litre from
  0.4 gm from today. Pump prices of the lower lead petrol grades
  are expected to be announced soon by the oil companies which
  have said wholesale prices are between 1.3 cents/litre to 3.2
  cents higher than previous grades.
  

SINGAPORE PETROLEUM CO REVISES PETROL PUMP PRICES
  Singapore Petroleum Co Pte Ltd will
  revise pump prices of petrol from June 2, an official said.
      Grade 97 octane with 0.15 gm/lead will be 96.8 cents/litre
  against 94 cents previously for 0.4 gm lead. Grade 92 octane
  will be 90.6 cents against 87.6 previously.
      SPC's price revision follows the Ministry of Trade and
  Industry's move to liberalise petrol pricing by allowing oil
  companies to set their own pump prices.
      New grades of petrol with lower lead content are sold in
  Singapore from today in line with the Ministry of Environment's
  regulations.
  

MOBIL RAISES SINGAPORE PETROL PUMP PRICES

  against 94 cents previously for 0.4 gm lead. Grade 92 octane
  will be 90.2 cents against 87.6 previously.
      SPC earlier announced its pump prices of 96.8 cents and
  90.6 cents for 97 and 92 octane, respectively, for 0.15 gm lead
  petrol which is being sold in Singapore from today in line with
  the Ministry of Environment's regulations.
  

SHELL, CALTEX, BP REVISE SINGAPORE PETROL PRICES
  Shell Eastern Pte Ltd will revise pump
  prices of petrol from 2300 hours local while Caltex Asia Ltd
  and BP Singapore Pte Ltd will revise theirs at midnight
  tonight, company officials said.
      Caltex and Shell will set prices of 0.15 gm lead at 96.8
  cents/litre for 97 octane and 90.2 cents for 92 octane. BP will
  set prices at 96.8 cents/litre and 90.6 cents, respectively.
  Previous industry pump prices for 0.4 gm lead were 94 cents for
  97 octane and 87.6 cents for 92 octane.
  

ESSO RAISES SINGAPORE PETROL PUMP PRICES
  Esso Singapore Pte Ltd said it raised
  pump prices of petrol from today.
      New prices for 0.15 gm lead grades are 97.0 cents/litre for
  97 octane and 90.8 cents for 95 octane.
      Other Singapore oil companies announced yesterday that they
  would revise their pump prices effective today.
      Shell Eastern Petroleum Pte Ltd, Mobil Oil Singapore Pte
  Ltd, Caltex Asia Ltd, Singapore Petroleum Co Pte Ltd and BP
  Singapore Pte Ltd are pricing 97 octane at 96.8 cents. Shell,
  Mobil and Caltex are pricing 92 octane at 90.2 cents, and SPC
  and BP at 90.6 cents.
  

SMALL RISE SEEN IN U.S. GASOLINE INVENTORIES
  U.S. analysts expect the American
  Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show
  a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended
  May 29, oil traders and analysts said.
      While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not
  rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that
  barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the
  report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.
      Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be
  steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil
  prices, the analysts said.
      Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports
  continue at relatively high levels.
      Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln
  barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.
      Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who
  looks for a build said, "We have had five weeks of gasoline
  demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to
  between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand
  would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw," he added.
      Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw
  in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.
     
      The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest
  report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline
  demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.
      But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to
  founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3
  pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.
      Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add
  to U.S. stocks.
      But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery
  runs.
      Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between
  700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level
  reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was
  discounted as having a market impact at this time.
      "A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,"
  one futures analyst said.
      Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build
  between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels
  reported by API for the week of may 22.
      The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added
  to the nation's inventory.

ESS0 LOWERS PREMIUM PETROL PUMP PRICE
  Esso Singapore Pte Ltd will lower the
  pump price of its premium 97 octane petrol price to 96.8
  cents/litre from 97 cents effective midnight tonight, a
  spokeswoman said.
      The new price is similar to other oil companies' price for
  the same grade.
      Esso's price for 95 octane remains unchanged at 90.8 cents.
  

SINGAPORE PETROLEUM CO RAISES OIL PRODUCT POSTINGS
  Singapore Petroleum Co Pte Ltd said it
  will raise posted prices for its products from June 19, by one
  cent/gallon for lpg, naphtha and gasoline, two cents for gas
  oil and by 60 cents/barrel for marine diesel oil.
      New prices are - lpg 36.0 cents/gallon, chemical naphtha

JAPAN FIRMS TO LAUNCH SALES OF 100 OCTANE GASOLINE
  Japanese oil companies are starting
  campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing
  domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources
  said.
      Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this
  summer, starting with &lt;Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.
      Showa Shell Sekiyu KK &lt;SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell
  98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.
      Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a
  higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted
  other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.
      "We have received a good response from consumers of Formula
  Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel
  consumption," Showa Shell said.
      Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher
  than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share
  of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.
      High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total
  gasoline sales in Japan, it added.
      Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct
  of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately
  after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.
      Nippon Oil Co Ltd &lt;NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100
  octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high
  octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline
  sales.
      The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share
  has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift
  gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station
  construction in the next two to three years.
      "Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline
  sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline
  production quotas," an official at a major oil company said.
      An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade
  and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government
  press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including
  the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil
  companies increase their international competitiveness.
      Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil,
  Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the
  production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.
      Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct
  from the previous year, according to a MITI report.
  

EXXON &lt;XON> EXTENDS MID-GRADE UNLEADED MARKETING
  Exxon Co U.S.A. said it is extending
  marketing of its mid-grade unleaded gasoline, Exxon Plus, into
  the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan areas beginning
  early next month.
      Exxon Corp's domestic subsidiary is already marketing the
  89-octane unleaded gasoline along much of the East Coast.
      As it introduces the third unleaded grade, Exxon noted, it
  no longer offers a leaded gasoline in the market, except in
  some rural areas where leaded gaosline will be made available
  to distributors who have a substantial need for the product to
  serve customers whose equipment was designed for leaded fuel.

(CORRECTED) - MOBIL &lt;MOB> TO UPGRADE REFINERY UNIT
  Mobil Corp said it will spend over 30
  mln dlrs to upgrade a gasoline-producing unit at its Beaumont,
  Texas, refinery.
      It said the unit is a catalytic reformer, which converts
  low-octane components of gasoline into high-octane components
  for use in Super Unleaded gasoline.
      The company said the modernization will allow the unit to
  regenerate catalysts on a continuous basis without shutdown.
  Currently, it must be shut twice a year.  The unit produces
  46,000 barrels of gasoline components a day.  Construction will
  start late this year, with completion set for mid-1989.
      (Correcting unit's output to barrels/day from barrels/year)
  

NEW GASOLINE GRADE TO RAISE U.S. REFINING COSTS
  A new grade of unleaded gasoline
  now being test marketed will increase refining costs when
  refiners can least afford it, according to officials attending
  the National Petroleum Refiners Association conference here.
      The new grade of unleaded gasoline has an octane level of
  89 compared with over 90 for super unleaded and 87 for regular
  unleaded gasoline.
       Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has test-marketed the new mid-grade
  gasoline and hopes to sell it on a regular basis in the South,
  East and Midwest by the beginning of June, according to Paul
  Collier, executive vice president of marketing.
      Phillips Petroleum &lt;P> expects to begin marketing the new
  89 octane unleaded gasoline in May, sources said.
      Converting current refinery operations to produce the 89
  octane unleaded gsoline could cost hundreds of millions of
  dollars per refinery but that depends on the present capacity
  and intensity of the refinery, said Amoco's Collier.
      But not all oil company's welcome the introduction of
  another grade of unleaded gasoline.
      "Three grades are not warranted," said Henry Rosenberg,
  chairman of Crown Central Petroleum &lt;CNP>. "Refiners will have
  to upgrade again," he added.
      "An investment will have to be made," said Archie Dunham,
  executive vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, an
  operating subsidiary of DuPont Corp &lt;DD> in order to upgrade
  refinery operations.
  

U.S. DISTILLATE, GASOLINE INVENTORIES SEEN LOWER
  Tonight's American Petroleum Institute
  weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns
  in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27,
  analysts and traders said.
      They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln
  barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3
  and four mln barrels.
      Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six
  mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5
  mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from
  the previous week or slightly higher or lower.
      For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks
  fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for
  the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between
  700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance
  gasoline stocks will be unchanged.
      API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the
  week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a
  similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock
  levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.
      The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal
  factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.
      Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended
  March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between
  3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended
  March 27.
      API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up
  three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said
  utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by
  less than one pct for the week ended March 27.
      Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market
  slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already
  partially reflected in today's gains, they added.
  

API SAYS DISTILLATE STOCKS OFF 2.52 MLN BBLS, GASOLINE OFF 260,000, CRUDE OFF 4.23 MLN

SWEDEN RAISES FUEL TAXES TO FUND DEFENCE SPENDING
  Sweden announced tax increases on
  petrol and heating oil from July 1, 1987 to help finance a 1.7
  pct rise in defence spending over the next five years.
      A Finance Ministry statement said the increase should boost
  the price of petrol by 0.13 crowns to an average of 4.21 crowns
  per litre while light-grade heating oil would go up by 30
  crowns per cubic metre to an average of 1,665 crowns.
      It said oil companies should absorb part of the tax rise
  internally and not pass it on to consumers as compensation for
  a reduction in the stocks that the industry is required to keep
  for Sweden's national petroleum reserve.
  

ENERGY/U.S. REFINING
  U.S. refiners said they are worried
  that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal
  environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade
  of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when
  the industry is recovering from a recent slump.
       "We have to look at national security and cut the amount
  of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the
  industry," said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum
  products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD).
      U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S.
  consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid
  1990s, according to the Department of Energy.
      "Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil
  requirements 15 or so years from now?" asked John Swearingen,
  chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp &lt;CIL> and
  former chief executive of Amoco Corp &lt;AN>. "If your answer to
  that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that
  we can now to cope with this situation and improve our
  position."
      But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a
  view echoed by others attending this week's National Petroleum
  Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.
      "Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging
  because those things won't solve our problems and could well
  compound them," said Swearingen. "Once the government affects
  values, once an import quota or license has value, it's going
  to be subverted by government," he added.
       William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of
  an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy
  Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to
  encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also
  said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged.
       Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct
  deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is 
  controversal but might work, said Dunham.
      Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil
  imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and
  product imports.
      "Why would companies import crude when they could import
  products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?"
  asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum
  &lt;CNP>.
       An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical
  products and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham
  said.
       "The energy security issue should be considered when
  environmental issues are considered," Martin said.
      "The level of investment for the proposed lowering of
  sulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is
  unacceptable," Dunham said. "Most companies cannot afford it."
      George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these
  proposals "will place pressure on small refining operations and
  promote further industry consolidation."
       An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at
  the conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct
  weight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway
  diesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs.
       The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986
  for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the
  average aromatics content was 32 pct.
       Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of
  facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which
  is beginning to be marketed by some companies.
      "What will be the standard octane level in various grades
  of unleaded gasoline?" asked Dunham. "A midlevel grade of
  unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an
  investment has to be made," Dunham said.
       This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg.
       Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to
  move higher in the next few months.
       "We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,"
  said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing
  company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA>.
       Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S.
  stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline
  demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said.
       "This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,"
  Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily
  a gasoline producer.
  

SUPPLIES, MIDEAST TENSION FUEL GAINS IN OIL
  Petroleum futures rallied today in a
  market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and
  became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting.
      Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the
  New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching
  life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17
  cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.
      "Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will
  not remain there long if products are not strong," Robert
  Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.
      Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the
  American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic
  inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.
      Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in
  the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new
  offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore
  oil fields and an oil export depot.
      Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and
  silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
      Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the
  close with support from the silver market, which was
  approaching two-year highs, traders said.
      Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of
  Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.
      Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and
  the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which
  is limiting supplies.
      In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected
  a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday's
  report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for
  export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack
  of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders
  said.
      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago
  Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.
      Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many
  farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather
  than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales
  have been lighter than expected this week.
      The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but
  prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as
  speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.
      Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength
  related to tight supplies.
      Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains
  past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat
  packers to bid aggressively for available animals.
      However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after
  the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract
  soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start
  of the year.
      New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil
  would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.

  Distillate fuel stocks held in
  primary storage rose by 628,000 barrels in the week ended April
  three to 106.96 mln barrels from a revised 106.33 mln the
  previous week, the American Petroleum Institute said.
      In its weekly statistical bulletin, the oil industry trade
  group said gasoline stocks rose 2.29 mln barrels to 247.91 mln
  barrels from a revised 245.62 mln, and crude oil stocks were up
  8.52 mln barrels to 337.73 mln from a revised 329.21 mln.
      It said residual fuel stocks rose 28,000 barrels to 38.25
  mln from a revised 37.98 mln barrels.
      API said refinery runs in the week rose to 12.54 mln
  barrels per day from 12.21 mln and refinery use of operating
  capacity was 80.4 pct, up from 78.3 pct.
      Crude oil imports in the week fell to 3.40 mln bpd from a
  revised 3.60 mln, API added.
  

EC BACKS NEW MOVE TO ENCOURAGE UNLEADED GASOLINE
  The EC Executive Commission has backed
  a plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasoline
  in a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel.
      It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow EC
  states to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing lead
  at six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by EC
  ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban.
  "It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said.
      But the Commission said imposing the ban would encourage
  the use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gas
  stations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had to
  stock.
  

TEXAS EASTERN &lt;TET> BUYS PETROLEUM TERMINAL

EIA SAYS DISTILLATE, GAS STOCKS OFF IN WEEK
  Distillate fuel stocks held in
  primary storage fell by 3.4 mln barrels in the week ended Feb
  27 to 128.4 mln barrels, the Energy Information Administration
  (EIA) said.
      In its weekly petroleum status report, the Department of
  Energy agency said gasoline stocks were off 100,000 barrels in
  the week to 251.5 mln barrels and refinery crude oil stocks
  were up 3.2 mln barrels to 333.0 mln.
      The EIA said residual fuel stocks fell 2.2 mln barrels to
  37.9 mln barrels and crude oil stocks in the Strategic
  Petroleum Reserve (SPR) were up 700,000 barrels to 516.5 mln.
      The total of all crude, refined product and SPR stocks were
  unchanged at 1,575.1 mln barrels, it said.
  

RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 2.1 PCT FROM YEAR AGO
  U.S. oil demand as measured by
  products supplied rose 2.1 pct in the four weeks ended February
  27 to 16.39 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 16.05 mln in the
  same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration
  (EIA) said.
      In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy
  Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.1 pct in
  the period to 3.37 mln bpd from 3.44 mln a year earlier.
      Gasoline demand averaged 6.60 mln bpd, up 2.4 pct from 6.44
  mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.47 mln bpd, up
  1.9 pct from 1.44 mln, the EIA said.
      Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln
  bpd, down 8.7 pct from 9.18 mln a year ago, and gross daily
  crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 4.11 mln
  bpd, up 36.9 pct from three mln, the EIA said.
      Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.21 mln bpd,
  up 2.2 pct from 12 mln a year earlier, it said.
      Year-to-date figures will not become available until March
  26 when EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987
  becomes available, the agency said.
  

BRAZIL STRIKES CAUSE GOVERNMENT MAJOR PROBLEMS
  Strikes by Brazil's 40,000
  seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing
  major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt
  crisis.
      A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25
  years and union leaders say they have seriously affected
  Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.
      On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest
  payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp
  deterioration in its trade balance.
      Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most
  petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial
  heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for
  higher fuel prices.
      There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages
  could lead to a serious fuel shortage.
      The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the
  72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.
      The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today
  entitled "Dangerous Confrontation," said: "From the economic
  point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost,
  with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the
  country's external trade."
      The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected
  offers of up to 100 pct.
      Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due
  to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior
  official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao
  Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless
  of the tribunal's ruling.
      Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse
  over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price
  freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not
  only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station
  owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao
  Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.
      Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of
  Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for
  exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.
      Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their
  profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six
  U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).
      Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last
  night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still
  could.
      Political sources said the government of President Jose
  Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel
  supply situation.
  

DOLE MULLS BILL TO EXTEND ETHANOL TAX EXEMPTION
  U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert
  Dole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are
  considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax
  exemption through the year 2000.
      Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association
  board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural
  task force of Republican members of Congress and governors.
      Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a
  six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise
  tax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992.
      Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness
  firms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley.
  The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite
  a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil.
  

RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 1.9 PCT FROM YEAR AGO
  U.S. oil demand as measured by
  products supplied rose 1.9 pct in the four weeks ended March
  six to 16.39 mln barrels per day from 16.08 mln in the same
  period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
  said.
      In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy
  Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.2 pct in
  the period to 3.33 mln bpd from 3.40 mln a year earlier.
      Gasoline demand averaged 6.75 mln bpd, up 3.3 pct from 6.53
  mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.40 mln bpd, off
  2.7 pct from 1.43 mln, the EIA said.
      Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln
  bpd, down 8.5 pct from 9.15 mln a year ago, and gross daily
  crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.67 mln
  bpd, up 23 pct from 2.97 mln, the EIA said.
      Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.05 mln bpd,
  up 1.5 pct from 11.87 mln a year earlier, it said.
      Year-to-date figures will not become available until March
  26 when EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987
  becomes available, the agency said.
  

WRIGHT SAYS A GAS TAX AN OPTION TO CUT DEFICIT
  House Speaker Jim Wright said a
  gasoline tax is one option to finding a way to reduce the
  deficit, but told reporters in response to a question he will
  not try to dictate a solution to the debt problem.
      Wright has made suggestions for raising taxes about 20
  billion dlrs as part of a budget plan to reduce the deficit.
  Tax proposals are being given consideration by members of the
  House Budget Committee, but the details of any tax increase
  would be made by the tax writing House ways and Means
  Committee.

ECUADOR ADOPTS AUSTERITY PROGRAM
  Ecuador announced an austerity program
  and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of last
  week's earthquake which killed at least 300 people.
      Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said in a televised
  address that the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct,
  government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top
  officials, including the president and cabinet, would be
  reduced.
      He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic
  consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of petrol
  would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by
  20 pct. Petrol supplies would also be limited.
      Information Ministry officials said the price freeze was
  aimed at protecting poor Ecuadoreans from a wave of
  specualtion. Violators would be severely punished, according to
  the price freeze order, signed by five cabinet ministers.
      The items for which prices were frozen included rice,
  sugar, cooking oil, potatoes, salt, wheat flour, cigarettes,
  soft drinks, school supplies and several kinds of vegetables.
      Ecuador's consumer price inflation was 23 pct in 1986.
      The price of 92-octane petrol rises to 110 sucres a U.S.
  Gallon from 65 sucres. Eighty-octane petrol increases to 90
  sucres from 50.

U.S. ENERGY FUTURES CALLED UNCHANGED TO LOWER
  Traders expect U.S. energy futures will
  open unchanged to slightly lower this morning with support near
  yesterday's lows.
      Crude futures are called unchanged to five cts weaker
  tracking unchanged domestic crudes and North Sea Brent crude,
  which traded at 18.01 dlrs a barrel today, about ten cts below
  yesterday's New York close.
      Traders said the supply squeeze in 15-day forward April
  Brent appears to have ended.
      Product futures, which fell sharply yesterday, are due to
  open unchanged to 0.25 cent lower, traders said.
      Traders expect some followthrough selling in products but
  said gasoil futures in London will probably lend some support
  since they are trading as expected. May gasoil futures were off
  1.50 dlrs a tonne this morning while June was down 1.25 dlrs in
  thin conditions.
  

EXXON &lt;XON> CUTS HEATING OIL PRICE, TRADERS SAID
  Oil traders in the New York area said
  Exxon Corp's Exxon U.S.A. unit reduced the price it charges
  contract barge customers for heating oil in New York harbor
  0.50 cent a gallon, effective today.
      They said the reduction brings Exxon's contract barge price
  to 49.75. The price decrease follows sharp declines in heating
  oil prices in the spot and futures markets, traders said.
  

ROYAL DUTCH &lt;RD> UNIT TO CUT HEATING OIL PRICE
  Royal Dutch/Shell's Scallop Petroleum
  Co subsidiary said it will reduce the price it charges contract
  barge customers in New York harbor for heating oil by 2.5 cts a
  gallon, effective tomorrow.
      The company said the price cut will bring the contract
  barge price for heating oil to 51 cts a gallon.
  

U.S. COURT UPHOLDS APEX DECISION FAVORING NYMEX
  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
  Second Circuit upheld a lower court decision dismissing a suit
  by Apex Oil Co against the New York Mercantile Exchange and
  several oil companies.
      The Court, however, ruled that Apex Oil could pursue
  anititrust and commodities market manipulation allegations
  against Belcher Oil Co, a unit of Coastal Corp &lt;CGP>.
      Apex Oil, primarily a trading company, charged that several
  companies, including Belcher, and NYMEX conspired to force it
  to deliver heating oil it had sold on the mercantile exchange,
  knowing Apex could not make full delivery.
     
      The NYMEX ordered Apex to deliver four mln barrels of
  heating oil sold via a February 1982 heating oil contract. Apex
  eventually fulfilled this obligation but claimed damages.
      Richard Wiener, attorney for Apex at Cadwalader Wickersham
  and Taft, said the company has not yet decided whether to
  pursue its case against Belcher Oil.
      The NYMEX, meanwhile, has a counterclaim pending against
  Apex Oil, seeking an unspecified amount of attorney's fees and
  15 mln dlrs in punitive damages, according to a NYMEX
  spokeswoman.
  

U.S. ENERGY COSTS ROSE IN FEBRUARY BY 1.9 PCT
  Consumer energy costs rose 1.9 pct
  in February following a sharp rise last month, the Labor
  Department said.
      The February increase in the overall energy costs,
  including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 0.2 pct
  drop in December and a 3.0 pct rise in January, it said.
      Energy prices were 12.2 pct below year-ago levels.
      The department's Consumer Price Index showed that the cost
  of gasoline rose in February by 4.2 pct, after a 6.6 pct rise
  in January.
      Gasoline prices were nonetheless 18.0 pct below their
  levels as of February 1986.
      Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas
  rose in February by 3.8 pct, putting it 14.9 pct under the
  year-ago figure.
      The index also showed that natural gas and electricity were
  unchanged last month, but down 3.5 pct from the February 1986
  figure, the department said.
      The index has been updated  o reflect 1982-84 consumption
  patterns; previously, the index was based on 1972-73 patterns.
  

U.S. DISTILLATE, GASOLINE INVENTORIES SEEN LOWER
  Tonight's American Petroleum Institute
  weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns
  in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27,
  analysts and traders said.
      They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln
  barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3
  and four mln barrels.
      Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six
  mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5
  mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from
  the previous week or slightly higher or lower.
      For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks
  fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for
  the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between
  700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance
  gasoline stocks will be unchanged.
      API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the
  week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a
  similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock
  levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.
      The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal
  factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.
      Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended
  March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between
  3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended
  March 27.
      API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up
  three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said
  utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by
  less than one pct for the week ended March 27.
      Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market
  slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already
  partially reflected in today's gains, they added.
  

SWEDEN RAISES FUEL TAXES TO FUND DEFENCE SPENDING
  Sweden announced tax increases on
  petrol and heating oil from July 1, 1987 to help finance a 1.7
  pct rise in defence spending over the next five years.
      A Finance Ministry statement said the increase should boost
  the price of petrol by 0.13 crowns to an average of 4.21 crowns
  per litre while light-grade heating oil would go up by 30
  crowns per cubic metre to an average of 1,665 crowns.
      It said oil companies should absorb part of the tax rise
  internally and not pass it on to consumers as compensation for
  a reduction in the stocks that the industry is required to keep
  for Sweden's national petroleum reserve.
  

GLOBAL RAISES HEAVY FUELS PRICES
  global petroleum corp said today it
  raised the posted cargo prices for number six fuel in the new
  york harbor 20 cts to 1.45 dlrs a barrel, effective today.
      the increase brings the prices for one pct sulphur to 21.30
  dlrs, up 20 cts; two pct sulphur 20.85 dlrs, up one dlr; 2.2
  pct sulphur 20.50, up 1.25 dlrs, and 2.5 pct sulphur 20.25
  dlrs, up 1.45 dlrs, it said.
      prices for 0.3 pct and 0.5 pct sulphur fuels were unchanged
  at 22.50 and 21.85 dlrs respectively, the company said.
  

SUN &lt;SUN> RAISES HEATING OIL BARGE PRICE
  Sun Co's Sun Refining and Marketing Co
  subsidiary said it raised the price it charges contract barge
  customers for heating oil in New York harbor by 0.50 cent a
  gallon, effective today.
      The increase brings the contract barge price to 50.50 cts a
  gallon, Sun said.
  

SUPPLIES, MIDEAST TENSION FUEL GAINS IN OIL
  Petroleum futures rallied today in a
  market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and
  became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting.
      Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the
  New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching
  life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17
  cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.
      "Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will
  not remain there long if products are not strong," Robert
  Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.
      Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the
  American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic
  inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.
      Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in
  the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new
  offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore
  oil fields and an oil export depot.
      Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and
  silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
      Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the
  close with support from the silver market, which was
  approaching two-year highs, traders said.
      Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of
  Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.
      Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and
  the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which
  is limiting supplies.
      In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected
  a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday's
  report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for
  export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack
  of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders
  said.
      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago
  Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.
      Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many
  farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather
  than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales
  have been lighter than expected this week.
      The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but
  prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as
  speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.
      Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength
  related to tight supplies.
      Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains
  past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat
  packers to bid aggressively for available animals.
      However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after
  the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract
  soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start
  of the year.
      New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil
  would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.
  

SUN &lt;SUN> RAISES HEATING OIL BARGE PRICE
  Sun Co's Sun Refining and Marketing
  subsidiary said it increased the price it charges contract
  barge customers for heating oil in New York harbor 0.50 cent a
  gallon, effective today.
      They said the 0.50 cent increase brings Sun's contract
  barge price to 49 cts. The recent price hike represents the
  fifth this week, totalling 4.75 cts. The increases are
  following sharp spot and futures price rises, the company said.
  

EXXON &lt;XON> RAISES HEATING OIL PRICE, TRADERS
  Oil traders in the New York area said
  Exxon Corp's Exxon U.S.A. increased the price it charges
  contract barge customers for heating oil in New York harbor by
  1.5 cts a gallon, effective Saturday, March 7.
      They said the increase brought Exxon's contract barge price
  to 50 cts a gallon.
      Traders said the price hike followed higher spot and
  futures market prices for heating oil.
  

LCE AND IPE ELECT FIRST TRADED OPTIONS MEMBERS
  The first 23 members have been elected to
  the joint traded options facility of the London Commodity
  Exchange (LCE) and the International Petroleum exchange (IPE),
  the exchanges said in a statement.
      More firms have applied and the final tranche will be
  admitted on April one and trading is planned to start in early
  June on the new trading floor on Commodity Quay.
      Traded options need a volatile and liquid futures base to
  succeed and chairman of the joint formation committee Jack
  Patterson said the existing LCE cocoa, coffee, sugar and IPE
  gas oil contracts should have no difficulty in providing this.
  

U.S. PRODUCER ENERGY PRICES RISE IN FEBRUARY
  Prices of wholesale finished energy
  goods in the United States were up in February, rising by 4.0
  pct after a 9.8 pct rise in January, the Labor Department said.
      The Producer Price Index for finished energy goods has
  fallen 20.9 pct in the past 12 months.
      Heating oil prices rose 3.0 pct in February after a 18.0
  pct rise in January, the department said.

  said.
      Prices for crude energy goods, such as crude oil, coal and
  gas at the wellhead, rose 2.6 pct last month after a 10.0 pct
  January rise. They were down 11.6 pct from February 1986, the
  department said.
       At the intermediate stage, liquefied petroleum gas prices
  rose 10.1 pct last month after a 5.0 pct January rise and were

  January rise and were off 21.3 pct from the year ago level.
      Prices of natural gas at the wellhead rose 1.8 pct in
  February after rising 4.2 pct a month earlier and were 14.8 pct
  lower than they were 12 months earlier, the department said.
      Coal costs were down 0.3 pct last month after rising 0.4
  pct in January and were down 0.8 pct from a year ago.
  

U.S. HEATING OIL FUTURES UP SHARPLY IN APRIL
  A supply shortage of number two oil in
  New York for prompt delivery boosted the April heating oil
  contract on U.S. energy futures, traders said.
      Crude oil futures followed but gasoline futures lagged.
  April heating oil ended 1.24 cts higher to 51.65 cts a gallon,
  while April crude settled 28 cts higher at 18.64 dlrs.
      "The rally was led by spot month heating oil contract,
  which seemed to move higher because of tigtened prompt
  deliveries in New York Harbor," said James Ritterbusch, vice
  president at Paine Webber Inc in Chicago.
      April gasoline was 0.28 cent higher at 53.15 cts a gallon.
      Ritterbusch said the market also found support from a
  report in the Middle East Economics Survey that said that OPEC
  oil output was down to about 14 mln barrels per day in the
  second week of March.
      "There was not a lot of interest to sell the market because
  of belief in OPEC," said Richard Redoglia, a broker with
  Merrill Lynch Futures Inc.
      Redoglia and Ritterbusch said April heating oil could
  continue to rally above 53 cts a gallon, while crude futures
  could test 19 dlrs a barrel before profit-taking stunts the
  move higher.
  

CALTEX RAISES SINGAPORE OIL PRODUCT PRICES
  Caltex Petroleum Corp, a joint venture
  between Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, said it raised
  posted prices for several petroleum products in Singapore,
  effective today.
       The company said its naphtha posting is up three cts a
  gallon to 43 cts. It said it is raising jet and kerosene
  postings 2.5 cts, bringing jet to 52.5 cts and kerosene to 51.5
  cts.
      Diesel grades are up two cts, Caltex said, bringing both
  diesel gas oil (one pct sulfur) and 52-57 D.I. (55 cetane) to
  52 cts a gallon, and diesel gas oil (0.5 pct) to 52 cts.
      The company said it is increasing medium and heavy fuel oil
  postings by one dlr a barrel. Medium is now 15.50 dlrs a
  barrel, and heavy fuel is 14.75 dlrs.
  

NYMEX TO SUBMIT PROPANE PROPOSAL TO CFTC
  The New York Mercantile Exchange expects
  to submit a propane futures contract for federal regulatory
  approval within a few days, according to an exchange
  spokeswoman.
      As previously announced, the Board of Governors of the
  exchange approved the contract last month. The exchange will
  now submit the contract to the Commodity Futures Trading
  Commission, according to the spokeswoman.
      Contract specifications will resemble those of heating oil
  and gasoline futures. The contract size will be 1,000 barrels,
  or 42,000 U.S. gallons.
      The minimum price fluctuation for the propane futures
  contract will be  0.01 cent per gallon, or 4.20 dlrs a barrel,
  according to the exchange.
      The maximum daily price limit will be two cts a gallon on
  all contracts except spot. Trading will terminate on the last
  business day of the month preceding the delivery month.
      The exchange said delivery will be F.O.B from the seller's
  pipeline, storage, or fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu,
  Texas, which has a direct pipeline access to the Texas Eastern
  Transmission Pipeline (TET) in Mont Beliview.
      Delivery method will be by in-line or in-well transfer,
  inter-facility transfer or pumpover, or book transfer and
  cannot be done earlier than the tenth calendar day of the
  delivery month, according to the exchange. Deliveries must be
  completed no later than two business days prior to the end of
  the delivery month.
      Buyers taking delivery of the propane must pay the seller
  by certified check and the deadline for payment is 1200 EST
  (noon) of the second business day following receipt of the
  propane.
  

EXXON &lt;XON> CUTS HEATING OIL BARGE PRICE
  Oil traders in New York said Exxon
  Corp's Exxon U.S.A. unit reduced the price it charges contract
  barge customers for heating oil in New York harbor 0.75 cent a
  gallon, effective today.
      They said the reduction brings Exxon's contract barge price
  to 43.25 cts. The price decrease follows sharp declines in
  heating oil prices on spot and futures markets, traders said.
  

PAKISTAN CONFIRMS KENYA TEA IMPORT INVESTIGATION
  Pakistan's Corporate Law Authority,
  CLA, has begun an enquiry into imports of tea from Kenya and
  the trade imbalance between the two countries, CLA chairman
  Irtiza Husain confirmed.
      He told Reuters by telephone that importers Liptons and
  Brooke Bond had been asked to supply data to the authority and
  a hearing would be held.
      The CLA would then report back to the Commerce Ministry,
  which had requested the enquiry. Husain said no date had yet
  been set for the hearing and declined to give further details
  of the matter.
      Industry sources told Reuters reports that the companies'
  tea import licences had been suspended were incorrect.
  

SRI LANKAN TEA WORKERS LAUNCH ONE-DAY PROTEST
  Thousands of tea workers of Indian origin
  went on strike today to press demands for citizenship and
  voting rights in Sri Lanka, a union statement said.
      The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) said its 400,000 members
  launched a prayer campaign at temples and other places in a
  non-violent protest to get the authorities to expedite
  citizenship procedures.
      A CWC spokesman said a three-day campaign was suspended
  after a Cabinet committee promised to speed up procedures under
  a new set of regulations. Trade sources said the strike did not
  affect production or today's Colombo auction.
  

INDIA RELAXES RULES FOR EXPORT PROMOTION
  The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,
  announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
  foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
  export earnings for export promotion abroad.
      The move is designed by the government to improve India's
  trade deficit.
      Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit
  Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
  textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
  electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
  goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
      The scheme replaces current rules which allow different
  amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
  minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
      RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will
  qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
  spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
  of annual export earnings.
      These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
  semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
  psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
      RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the
  two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
  freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
      Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
  higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
  holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
  RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.
  

STATE TO CONTROL 70 PCT OF PAKISTAN TEA IMPORTS
  Pakistan announced a new tea import
  policy, saying 70 pct of imports will in future be made through
  the state Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP).
     Commerce Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a television
  broadcast that no more than one-third of the remaining 30 pct
  allocated to the private sector would be permitted to come from
  any one country.
     The new policy was announced some three months after the
  government suspended import licences and ordered an inquiry
  into tea purchase policy.
     Traders said the move was designed to put pressure on Kenya,
  which provided some 48 pct of Pakistan's 75-80 mln kilo annual
  tea imports, to buy Pakistani manufactured goods in exchange.
      Liptons and Brooke Bond, two units of Britain's Unilever
  Plc, control 95 pct of Pakistan's hard-pack tea market, traders
  said.
     Haq, who is also Planning Minister, was outlining a new
  three-year trade policy from the start of financial 1987/88 on
  July 1.
  

INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP
  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      "The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports.
      However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
  against three billion in 1985/86.
      Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
  narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
  Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
      The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
  billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
  in the current fiscal year.
      But the push to include non-communist countries in
  countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
  growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
  shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
      One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
  countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
  officially support bartering.
      The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
      "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
  for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,
  adding that the policy remains flexible.
      "We also take into account other factors such as prices at
  which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade
  official said.
      Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
  companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
  if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
  sources said.
      Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.
      In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy
  Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct
  sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.
      "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"
  he added.
      Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign
  currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to
  buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in
  exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.
      But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some
  inherent problems, they added.
      "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that
  the trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "The
  other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy
  commodities which the other party wants."
      Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it
  as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of
  payments difficulty.
      "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.
  It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy."

PAKISTANI DECISION WILL HURT KENYAN TEA EXPORTS
  Pakistan's decision to suspend tea
  import licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short term
  while exporters seek new markets, sources close to Nairobi
  broking houses and exporters said.
      Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo
  yesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences in
  order to link tea imports to Pakistani exports.
      The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports to
  Pakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, while
  imports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenya
  provides over 50 pct of Pakistan's tea imports.
      The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did not
  come as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of the
  trade imbalance for some time.
      "We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ...
  (it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short term
  as Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market," a source at one
  broking house told Reuters.
      One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affected
  Kenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an average
  fall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasa
  last Monday.
      "The trend is likely to continue until other countries
  replace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,"
  he added.
      Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan,
  Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as major
  markets for its tea, the sources added.
      Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan would
  be worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longer
  to find new outlets, they said.
  

ABNORMAL RADIATION FOUND IN SOVIET TEA/HAZELNUTS
  Abnormally high levels of radiation were
  found in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months after
  the Chernobyl nuclear accident, West German residents in Moscow
  were advised this week.
      In a letter to the West German community here, Ambassador
  Joerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought in
  Moscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and
  -137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts.
      Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University,
  including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, were
  found to be free of radiation, it said.
      Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts contained
  caesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by the
  United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
      The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no
  particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the
  tea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts.
      The products sent for testing were bought in state shops
  and private farmers' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Western
  embassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratory
  testing of Soviet food late last year because no abnormal
  radiation levels were detected.
      "We didn't find anything so we stopped doing it," a U.S.
  Embassy spokesman said.
      A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipment
  remained in the embassy waiting room for British residents in
  Moscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests had
  not been conducted for several months.
      "Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as a
  precautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of any
  alarming signals," he said. "If the tests had shown abnormal
  readings, they would have been resumed."
  

INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW
  Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow
  by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
  in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
  declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
      Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to
  fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
  26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
  Indonesia"s agricultural performance.
      The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
  26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
  1987.
      The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
  tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
  a drawdown on stocks.
      "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
  promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
  production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
  gain," the report says.
      "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
  to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
  and palm kernels."
      Constraints to significant overall increases in
  agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
  seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
  farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
  report underlines.
      The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
  pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
  largely offset gains in yields.
      The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
  insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
  resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
  resistant rice types.
      The government is depending on increased production of
  export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
  palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
  oil prices.
      Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
  in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
  to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
  report says.
      But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
  rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
  also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
      The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
  meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
  September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
  in domestic demand.
      The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic
  performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
  negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
  mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
  in 1984.
      The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
  for the slump.
  

INDONESIAN TEA, COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP, COFFEE DOWN
  Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa
  will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are
  forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the
  government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said.
      The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture
  forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60
  kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags
  produced in 1985/86.
      In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to
  5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln
  in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags.
      The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln
  tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a
  fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of
  quotas by the International Coffee Organisation.
      Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily
  as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of
  cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985
  from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government
  to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.
      Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000
  tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.
      The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes
  this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.
      The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of
  Indonesian cocoa beans.
      The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC
  (crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase
  significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new
  CTC processing plants.
      Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing
  more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.
      Production of black and green teas is forecast in the
  embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from
  123,000 tonnes in 1986.
      Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes
  in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.
      The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality
  controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more
  competititve in the world market.
  

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS
  Three geographically diverse droughts
  in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a
  reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino
  weather pattern, &lt;Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather
  forecasting service, said.
      Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane
  growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face
  serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive
  in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government
  officials and meteorologists said.
      Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said
  the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces
  have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.
      Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.
      Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan
  was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for
  over 20 years, the paper said.
      The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct
  compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many
  rivers, it added.
      This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing
  shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the
  Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many
  ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.
      Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across
  China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has
  recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average
  since early February.
      The New China News Agency said the average December
  temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher
  than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.
      Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka
  and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of
  Plantation Industries officials told Reuters
      In Australia, concern is growing about below-average
  rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the
  Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local
  Meteorological Bureau officials said.
      For many farmers and government officials the fear is that
  while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major
  threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the
  wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.
      Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought
  which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the
  occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as
  El Nino, they said.
      Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the
  Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single
  cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.
      Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for
  agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'
  was unique.
      The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and
  the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last
  major event in 1982/83, it said.
      El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears around
  Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds
  and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast
  of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with
  the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade
  winds, meteorologists said.
      The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise the
  sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.
      When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends
  a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it
  collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.
      One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the
  rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the
  Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.
      The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather
  said.
      China, where the affected areas have received between 40
  and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the
  May-September rains, it said.
      The May-September rains normally provide the
  drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.
      In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have
  received less than half the normal rainfall during the current
  wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing
  as the rainy season draws to an end.
      In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be
  at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually
  occur between April and June, although it is not possible at
  this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.
  

VIETNAM TO RESETTLE 300,000 ON STATE FARMS IN 1987
  Vietnam will resettle 300,000 people on
  state farms known as new economic zones in 1987, to create jobs
  and grow more high-value export crops, the communist party
  newspaper Nhan Dan said.
      Yesterday's edition, received here today, said Vietnam
  would invest one billion dong, including the costs of
  relocation, in 272 new economic zones. About one third of that
  sum would be spent on export crops such as coffee, tea, rubber
  and pepper in the Central Highlands, it said.
      Since 1975, Vietnam has resettled about three million
  people from cities and crowded river deltas to the zones.
  

SOVIET PAPER DETAILS GEORGIAN FLOOD DAMAGE
  Floods and avalanches killed 110 people
  and caused around 350 mln roubles worth of damage in the
  southern Soviet republic of Georgia earlier this year, the
  government daily Izvestia said.
      Some 80,000 hectares of agricultural land and gardens had
  been inundated, damaging tea plantations and orange groves, the
  newspaper said. It added that spring sowing in southern parts
  of the country was some two weeks behind schedule because of
  the late thaw but gave no precise crop estimates.
      In the most detailed report to date on the heavy snows in
  January and floods in February, Izvestia said 8,200 people had
  been evacuated from mountain areas, 4,500 houses had been
  damaged and hundreds of kilometres of roads and power lines had
  been destroyed.
      A separate article in the daily warned that a sudden thaw
  was expected shortly in the Ukraine and southern parts of
  Russia, which experienced record snows this winter.
      Preventive measures have already been taken in some areas
  including the evacuation of cattle.
  

INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND
  The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is
  likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and
  possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian
  Nainggolan said.
      He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in
  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.
      Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil
  may also be introduced. But he said the question was still
  being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no
  decision on when to go ahead had been made.
      The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber
  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.
      "Several factors make us move cautiously," Nainggolan said.
  "We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a
  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."
      Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee
  added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to
  five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are
  traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,
  exchange officials said.
      The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the
  introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one
  official said a feasibility study was needed first. No
  decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April
  23, traders said.
      Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the
  world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should
  expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of
  the exchange would help this.
      Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost
  overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.
      He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to
  encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would
  also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to
  encourage participation.
      Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start
  although trading in coffee has been disappointing.
      Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in
  April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9
  mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered
  locally, the latest exchange report said.
       Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905
  tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.
       Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and
  44 traders.
  

COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE
  A Colombia government trade official has
  urged the business community to aggressively diversify its
  activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.
      Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade
  Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become
  what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally
  Colombia's major export.
      The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987
  coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or
  about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up
  another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.
  

COFFEE COULD DROP TO 70/80 CTS, CARDENAS SAYS
  International coffee prices could drop to
  between 70 and 80 cents a lb by next October if no agreement is
  reached to support the market, Jorge Cardenas, manager of
  Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation said.
      Speaking at a forum for industrialists, he said one of the
  reasons was that the market was already saturated and that
  producers will have excess production and stockpiles of 39 mln
  (60-kg) bags in 1987.
      Today, May futures in New York settled at 107.90 cents a
  lb.
  

COLOMBIA COFFEE REGISTRATIONS REMAIN OPEN
  Colombia's coffee export registrations
  remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new
  marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,
  Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'
  association said.
      "The philosophy of the new policy is not to close
  registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed," he told
  Reuters.
      On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and
  May for an unlimited amount.
      Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters
  had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,
  or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the
  average in recent years.
      He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national
  coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total
  of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by
  Colombia.
      "The only change that could happen is, because of the
  volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations
  would be for June shipment, etc" Arango said.

PRICES GENERALLY LOWER AT NAIROBI COFFEE AUCTION
  Prices were lower at this week's coffee
  auction for all grades and qualities except better quality AB
  grades, which held steady, the Coffee Board of Kenya said.
      The board said it offered 35,000 bags and sold 32,876.
      So far this coffee year, Kenya has sold 918,707 bags to all
  markets, of which 326,182 are for the 1986/7 pool, with an
  overall average price of 41,500 shillings a tonne, it added.
      The board will offer 35,000 bags at its next auction on

COLOMBIA JAN EXPORTS UP BUT COFFEE VALUES FALL
  The value of colombian exports other than
  coffee rose 55 pct in january compared with the same period
  last year, apparently setting a trend for the trade balance in
  1987, government statistics institute figures show.
      They amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared with 147.5 mln
  dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last year.
      The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared
  with a 56 mln dlr surplus in january 1986.
      The national planning department forecast that in 1987
  coffee, colombia's traditional major export, will account for
  only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.
  

EXPORTS OTHER THAN COFFEE RISE SHARPLY IN COLOMBIA
  Colombian exports other than coffee rose
  55 pct in January compared with the same period last year,

  with 147.5 mln dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last
  year.
      The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared

UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES
  Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)
  has stopped offering coffee on the international market because
  it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.
      The board suspended offerings last week but because of its
  urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it
  could sustain, the sources added.
      Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been
  waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had
  trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the
  Kenyan port of Mombasa.
      Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by
  holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from
  coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.
      The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money
  and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty
  for such delays, it added.
      Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that
  commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings
  -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the
  current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100
  billion.
      The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of
  annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.
      The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export
  earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is
  likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.
      CMB officials have forecast that because the government has
  restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will
  produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending
  September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.
  

PATON REPORTS U.S. GREEN COFFEE ROASTINGS HIGHER
  U.S. roastings of green coffee in the
  week ended April 4 were about 275,000 (60-kilo) bags, including
  that used for soluble production, compared with 215,000 bags in
  the corresponding week of last year and about 320,000 bags in
  the week ended March 28, George Gordon Paton and Co Inc
  reported.
      It said cumulative roastings for calendar 1987 now total
  4,440,000 bags, compared with 4,540,000 bags by this time last
  year.
  

COLOMBIA JUNE COFFEE REGISTRATIONS OPENED
  Colombia has opened coffee
  registrations for June shipment with no limit set for private
  exporters, as in April and May, a National Coffee Growers'
  Federation official said.
      Colombia has sold an average of 900,000 bags per month
  since the beginning of the calendar year.
  

MILD COFFEE GROWERS TO MEET IN GUATEMALA
  A large group of "other milds"
  coffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next month
  to map their strategy for next September's meeting of the
  International Coffee Organisation (ICO).
      Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Rican
  coffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the Dominican
  Republic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five
  central american nations will participate in the two-day
  strategy session beginning May 4.
      The main topic will be reform of what many producing
  countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export
  quotas, Fernandez said.
      He said Costa Rica would press for quotas "based on the
  real production and export potential of each country in the
  past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic"
  production levels rather than recent harvests and crop
  estimates.
  

FRENCH AID TO TOGO TO HELP COFFEE, COCOA TREES
  France is to provide Togo with 475 mln cfa
  francs of aid for a range of projects that include development
  of the coffee and cocoa industries and reafforestation in the
  south of the country, official sources said.
  

MEXICO HAS NO PLANS TO LEAVE ICO
  Mexico has no intention of leaving
  the International Coffee Organization (ICO), in the event of
  Brazil withdrawing from the group, the Mexican Coffee Institute
  (IMC) said.
      The IMC said in a statement the ICO is an important
  instrument for ensuring producers obtain an adequate price.
  Mexico currently produces around five mln 60-kilo bags of
  coffee per year.
      Brazil said during a meeting of coffee producers in Rio de
  Janeiro over the weekend that it would consider leaving the ICO
  if its export quota was reduced by the organization.
  

RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA
  European coffee traders and roasters
  may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee
  Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting
  here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.
      Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the
  possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the
  world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the
  next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.
      "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's
  attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.
      However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,
  which began here today and is to continue to the end of the
  week, has revealed gaps in the European position on
  re-introducing quotas.
      Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against
  re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in
  favour with the single proviso that there had to be some
  formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing
  countries.
      The roasters said the positions were generally fairly
  close, and problems with some Government officials.
      Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized
  Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.
      Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota
  re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.
      "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the
  end of the week to at least present a common European Community
  (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the
  International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said.
      "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not
  only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"
  one official said.
      "We have learned that we can live without the quotas that
  were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the
  stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not
  simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as
  quota allocation is concerned," he added.
      Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the
  likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly
  pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.
      "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the
  consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota
  re-introduction, " he said.
      "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new
  Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least
  negotiable position of any of his predecessors," one trader
  said.
      "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of
  the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under
  a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which
  gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota
  meeting in September," the official said.
  

IBC DETAILS PLANS TO PAY CREDITORS
  The Brazilian Coffee Institute,
  IBC, gave details of its plans to pay the 18 companies that
  bought 630,000 bags of robusta coffee in the London market on
  its behalf last September.
      An IBC spokesman told Reuters that a 15 mln dlr loan from
  the Banco do Brasil would be used to pay five mln dlrs a month
  in June, July and August to creditors.
      He said an auction of coffee would raise additional money
  and added that a Reuter report on June 16 gave the wrong
  impression that the auction was necessary to raise part of the
  15 mln dlrs. No date has yet been set for the auction.
  

EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA
  European coffee roasters and traders
  have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee
  Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.
      Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee
  Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.
      The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
  would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
  coffee agreement, van Horick said.
      If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
  ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
  agreement, van Horick said.
      Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
  Brazil.
      Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
      "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
  formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
  leaves it very little to object to," van Horick said.
      "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
  reflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formula
  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
  everyone."
      Although full implications of the new formula have still to
  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
  Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly
  higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El
  Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.
      Because the proposal provides that future quota
  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
      "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
  new quota formula, " van Horick said.
      At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.
      "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
  just get an agreement," van Horick added.
  

COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S.
  A U.S. government trade official
  responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on
  coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian
  efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.
      Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just
  back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing
  countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be
  agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.
      "There is one country which evidently still does not,"
  Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has
  been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.
      Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook
  for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September
  International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.
      He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical
  discussions with Colombian officials.
      While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the
  Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,
  Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said.
      The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month
  which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula
  for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns
  with the technical details of the Colombian plan.
      Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment
  on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by
  European coffee roasters and traders.
      Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick
  said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving
  averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for
  the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.
      The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas
  unless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in the
  coffee market are used to set export limits.
  

RIO DE JANEIRO - IBC ESTIMATES 1987-88
COFFEE CROP AT 35.2 MLN BAGS

  RIO DE JANEIRO - IBC ESTIMATES 1987-88
  COFFEE CROP AT 35.2 MLN BAGS
  

BRAZIL COULD EXPORT 19 MLN BAGS OF COFFEE -IBC
  Brazil's coffee exports could amount to
  19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimate
  of 35.2 mln bags, an IBC spokesman said.
      He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln
  bags mark, especially if the final harvest to be conducted in
  October and November confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags.
      He said the average limit of errors for the official crop
  harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first
  estimates officially published today.
      He said the IBC agreed with a request by producers for the
  Institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the
  guarantee minimum price.
  

IVORY COAST WEATHER NO PROBLEM FOR 1986/87 CROPS
  Ivory Coast rainfall this season has
  been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee
  production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily
  Fraternite Matin reported.
      The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry
  conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.
  Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if
  there is good rainfall in coming weeks.
      Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest
  in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has
  especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin
  said.
      Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this
  month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,
  compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.
      Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture
  had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not
  need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have
  been affected in some regions, it added.
      London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast
  1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,
  which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described
  early development of the new main crop as patchy.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year
  forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast
  due to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated
  the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's
  4.33 mln bag harvest.
      Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee
  crop as "normal."
  

INDIA RELAXES RULES FOR EXPORT PROMOTION
  The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,
  announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
  foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
  export earnings for export promotion abroad.
      The move is designed by the government to improve India's
  trade deficit.
      Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit
  Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
  textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
  electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
  goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
      The scheme replaces current rules which allow different
  amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
  minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
      RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will
  qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
  spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
  of annual export earnings.
      These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
  semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
  psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
      RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the
  two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
  freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
      Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
  higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
  holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
  RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.
  

DAUSTER SAYS CONSUMERS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF QUOTAS
  Consumer countries should not
  intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas,
  Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.
      "Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of
  producers as has been traditional," Dauster, a delegate at the
  recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. "When consumers
  want to get involved, talks are much more difficult."
      The main consumer country the United States and main
  producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution
  when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in
  February.
      Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in
  September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its
  market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the
  hands of producer countries.
      "We have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this year
  we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we
  are not in a position to do favours."
  

U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED
  A voluntary compliance system for
  monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
  skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
  trade sources.
      "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
  the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
  became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one
  analyst said.
      On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
  the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
  voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
  monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
      Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
  importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
  U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
  authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
  it will still be allowed entry.
      While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
  overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
  will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
  monitoring controls, trade sources said.
      "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
  to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a
  U.S. Customs spokesman said.
      "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
  its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
  Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
  destination)," he said.
      Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
  importers will abide by the quota system.
      "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
  quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.
       "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
  not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without
  the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
  producers' hands."
      Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
  voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
  in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
  Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
  countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
  labelled.
      According to customs officials, several green coffee
  importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
  fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
  forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
  beans.
      "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
  one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
  their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
  circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst
  Bernie Savaiko.
      Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
  pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
  the U.S. in the near term.
      "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
  have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
  seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
  much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
  threat," one trader said.
  

IBC SEEKS EXPORT DETAILS TO SET COFFEE QUOTAS
  The Brazilian Coffee Institute
  (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to
  submit details of past export performance in order that
  individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.
      He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed
  acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals
  to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export
  performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.
      Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
  months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be
  used for calculating the export performace portion.
      The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers
  participation and use this as a basis for allocation of
  individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.
      He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo
  Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.
  Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable
  on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this
  premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export
  sales declaration form.
      Auctions will not start until after the opening of export
  registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be
  but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of
  the week, opening registraions from Monday.
      A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the
  CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for
  allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,
  the spokesman added.
      A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished
  in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure
  shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.
  

ICO EXECUTIVE BOARD TO MEET EARLY NOVEMBER
  The International Coffee Organization
  (ICO) Executive Board is to hold a meeting on November 3/4, its
  first since export quotas were re-introduced early this month.
      An ICO spokesman said the session, for the first time under
  the chairmanship of Bruno Caron of France, will review the
  market situation and the operation of quotas.
      On November 5 the six exporters making up the ICO Board of
  Management of the Promotion Fund will review its program for
  the 1987/88 year (Oct/Sept) and items left over from 1986/87.
      On November 2 a six nation working group will consider
  stock verification in Papua New Guinea.
  

COLOMBIA OPENS COFFEE REGISTRATIONS - LDN TRADE
  Colombia has opened export registrations
  for November coffee shipments, trade sources said. No further
  details were available.
  

UGANDA PLANS TO EXPORT ROASTED COFFEE TO EUROPE
  Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to
  Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.
      A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of
  Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind
  and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in
  December and the factory should be ready by next October.
      He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee
  Marketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000
  tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also
  told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan
  from the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.
      Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and
  expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.
      Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit
  Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln
  (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the
  latest International Coffee Agreement.
      In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be
  substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.
      The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of
  which is used to produce instant coffee.
  

COFFEE, SUGAR AND COCOA EXCHANGE NAMES CHAIRMAN
  The New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
  Exchange (CSCE) elected former first vice chairman Gerald
  Clancy to a two-year term as chairman of the board of managers,
  replacing previous chairman Howard Katz.
      Katz, chairman since 1985, will remain a board member.
      Clancy currently serves on the Exchange board of managers
  as chairman of its appeals, executive, pension and political
  action committees.
      The CSCE also elected Charles Nastro, executive vice
  president of Shearson Lehman Bros, as first vice chairman.
  Anthony Maccia, vice president of Woodhouse, Drake and Carey,
  was named second vice chairman, and Clifford Evans, president
  of Demico Futures, was elected treasurer.
  

CARDENAS SEES NO MAJOR DECISIONS AT ICO MEETING
  Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's
  coffee growers' federation, said he did not believe any
  important decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting of
  the International Coffee Organization (ICO).
      The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March
  31 and could decide to call a special council session by the
  end of April to discuss export quotas.
      "It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has
  been happening in the market, but it's unlikely any major
  decisions are taken," Cardenas told journalists.
      Earlier this month, talks in London to re-introduce export
  quotas, suspended in February 1986, ended in failure.
      Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking to
  reporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committee
  meeting, said the positions of Brazil and of the United States
  were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.
      Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil
  would not change its coffee policies.
      Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer
  because the trade knew the projected output and stockpile
  levels of producers.
      He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfall
  of nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October,
  the start of the coffee year, and February.
  

KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS
  The Kenyan economy is heading for
  difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must
  tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging
  too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.
      In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said
  high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth
  of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.
      The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of
  payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in
  1985, he added.
      "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a
  result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange
  reserves during the year," he said.
      The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign
  exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a
  peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.
      Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a
  barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.
      Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline
  in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more
  difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.
      Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on
  servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of
  capital for the first time in its history, he added.
      "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult
  phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that
  we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign
  sources to finance our development," he said.
      "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on
  expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the
  lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more
  frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added.
  

INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP
  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      "The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports.
      However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
  against three billion in 1985/86.
      Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
  narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
  Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
      The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
  billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
  in the current fiscal year.
      But the push to include non-communist countries in
  countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
  growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
  shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
      One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
  countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
  officially support bartering.
      The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
      "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
  for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,
  adding that the policy remains flexible.
      "We also take into account other factors such as prices at
  which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade
  official said.
      Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
  companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
  if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
  sources said.
      Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.
      In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy
  Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct
  sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.
      "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"
  he added.
      Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign
  currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to
  buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in
  exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.
      But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some
  inherent problems, they added.
      "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that
  the trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "The
  other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy
  commodities which the other party wants."
      Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it
  as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of
  payments difficulty.
      "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.
  It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy."
  

ZIMBABWE COFFEE OUTPUT SET TO RISE
  Zimbabwean coffee output will reach
  13,000 tonnes this year, up on just over 11,000 tonnes produced
  in 1986, the Commercial Coffee Growers Association said.
      Administrative Executive Robin Taylor told the domestic
  news agency ZIANA that Zimbabwe earned the equivalent of 33 mln
  U.S. Dlrs from coffee exports last year. He would not say how
  much the country would earn in 1987.
      Taylor said the 173 commercial coffee growers under his
  association had increased production from 5,632 tonnes in 1980
  to more than 11,000 tonnes in l986.
  

INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS
  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,

COFFEE PRICES BAD NEWS FOR LATIN AMERICA -MINISTER
  A senior Nicaraguan official said a
  recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically
  disastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries.
      Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca
  was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)
  executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend
  in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to
  discuss the fall in coffee prices.
      London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to
  1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.
      Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed
  to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on
  Latin America, both economically and politically.
      He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to
  pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.
      Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under
  an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago
  when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.
      Central American economic ministers have estimated the
  region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in
  1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,
  Martinez said.
      He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because
  consumer members lack the political will to fully support
  commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to
  producers.
  

PATON REPORTS U.S. GREEN COFFEE ROASTINGS HIGHER
  U.S. roastings of green coffee in the
  week ended March 21 were about 250,000 (60-kilo) bags,
  including that used for soluble production, compared with
  195,000 bags in the corresponding week of last year and about
  300,000 bags in the week ended March 14, George Gordon Paton
  and Co Inc reported.
      It said cumulative roastings for calendar 1987 now total
  3,845,000 bags, compared with 4,070,000 bags by this time last
  year.
  

TOP QUALITIES SOUGHT ON HAMBURG COFFEE MARKET
  The green coffee market saw some demand
  for high quality coffees in the past week, but business was
  described as generally unsatisfactory, trade sources said.
      Especially sought were spot East African and Ethiopian and
  some Brazils, they said, adding that some high grade robustas
  also met some demand.
      Sporadic business was noted in the second hand which
  offered Kenya coffee for May/June shipment up to 25 dlrs below
  origin levels.
      Roasters are said to be well covered and are not expected
  to enter the market for larger purchases in the near term.
  

COFFEE TALKS COLLAPSE EASES NEED FOR U.S. BILL
  The collapse of International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes the
  immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the
  customs service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.
      The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation
  offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee
  imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A
  bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).
      However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach
  agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not
  immediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the
  coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.
      "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)
  this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.
  

U.S. SEES NO NEW COFFEE AGREEMENT TALKS SOON
  The United States does not expect
  the executive board meeting of the International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, to call for a new round of negotiations on
  reinstating coffee quotas, a U.S. government official said.
      The official, a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talks
  earlier this year, said no new coffee agreement talks are
  expected because there is no indication the negotiating
  positions of major producers and consumers have changed.
      The U.S. still demands, as a condition of reimposition of
  coffee quotas, that "objective criteria" be set for
  establishing quotas, said the U.S. official, who asked not to
  be identified. Brazil, the major producer, insists on quotas
  based on a traditional formula.
      The U.S. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if
  some new flexibility is apparent from major countries, the
  official said.
      The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London.
  

ICO BOARD SEEN UNLIKELY TO SET NEW COFFEE TALKS
  Chances that the International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree
  to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO
  delegates and trade sources said.
      ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are
  ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that
  reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.
      ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days
  when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.
       "Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions,
  it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,"
  Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be
  negotiated sometime, he said.
       The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas
  but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower
  its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates
  said.
       At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO
  board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the
  reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some
  administrative matters, according to a draft agenda.
      The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio
  Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and
  chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the
  meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a
  non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.
      "I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among
  producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal
  by September (the next scheduled council meeting)," Bronwyn
  Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.
      Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a
  date will be set for an earlier council meeting.
      If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the
  coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the
  remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.
      When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest
  coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another
  for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.
      Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,
  under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,
  but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares
  to be redistributed using "objective criteria," which would have
  threatened Brazil's share.
      At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers,
  Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their
  objections as members of the group of eight ICO "dissident"
  producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in
  prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez
  Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief
  producers on the Managua meeting.
      However, other producers said they were not aware of this
  move toward producer solidarity.
      London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today,
  down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March.
  

CHINA DAILY SAYS VERMIN EAT 7-12 PCT GRAIN STOCKS
  A survey of 19 provinces and seven cities
  showed vermin consume between seven and 12 pct of China's grain
  stocks, the China Daily said.
      It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of
  China's fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up
  to 30 pct, of its vegetables. The paper blamed the waste on
  inadequate storage and bad preservation methods.
      It said the government had launched a national programme to
  reduce waste, calling for improved technology in storage and
  preservation, and greater production of additives. The paper
  gave no further details.
  

THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER
  Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
  billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
  year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up
  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.
  

SRI LANKA GETS USDA APPROVAL FOR WHEAT PRICE
  Food Department officials said the U.S.
  Department of Agriculture approved the Continental Grain Co
  sale of 52,500 tonnes of soft wheat at 89 U.S. Dlrs a tonne C
  and F from Pacific Northwest to Colombo.
      They said the shipment was for April 8 to 20 delivery.
  

JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.
  Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
  U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
  tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
  a senior ministry official said.
      "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
  by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,
  said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
  its farm import market," he said.
      Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
  protect local farmers.
      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
  beef accord next March 31.
      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
  some one billion dlrs in new business.
      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
  industrial sector.
      "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
  issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official
  said.
  

ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE
  The Zambian government has no immediate
  plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of
  maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
  official of the ruling party said.
      Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
  refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
  which at least 15 people died.
      That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
  revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
  (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
      However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
  dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
  increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
  a practice discouraged by the IMF.
      "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
  meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
  demands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry of
  Agriculture economist said.
  

FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED
  Argentine grain producers adjusted
  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
  end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
      They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
      However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
      Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
      There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
      Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
  crops, including soybean.
      However, as the lands began drying later in the week
  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
      Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
      The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln.
      Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
      Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
  sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
      Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
  previously.
      This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
  tonnes.
      Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
      Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires in mid-April.
      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
  mln tonne crop.
      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
  7.1 mln.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
  sown in 1985/86.
      The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
  this were not available.
      Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
  will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
  not been as intense as in previous years.

BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS
  Storage problems with Brazil's record
  grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
  tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
      Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
  told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
  year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
      He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
  harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
  problems.
      Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
  theoretically sufficient for the crop.
      But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
  distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
      The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
  growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
  capacity.
      Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
      In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
  storing loose grain, Brito said.
      Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
  crops.
      The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
  has been evident from television reports, which have shown
  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.
  

TUNISIA EXPECTED TO TENDER FOR FRENCH WHEAT
  Tunisia is expected to tender April 14 for
  100,000 tonnes of French soft wheat for delivery between May
  and August and which would be covered by the French export
  credit agency, COFACE, export credits, traders said here.
      No official tender has been announced yet by Tunisia, they
  said.
      France has sold a total of 200,000 tonnes of soft wheat to
  Tunisia since the begining of the current campaign which was
  covered by COFACE export credits. Of this amount, a total of
  150,000 tonnes was exported by March 1, they said.
  

CCC ACCEPTS EXPORT BID FOR WHEAT FLOUR TO IRAQ
  The Commodity Credit Corporation has
  accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover a sale of 12,500
  tonnes of wheat flour to Iraq, the U.S. AGriculture Department
  said.
      The bonus awarded was 113.0 dlrs per tonne and will be paid
  to Peavey Company in the form of commodities from CCC stocks.
      The wheat flour is for delivery May 15-June 15, 1987, the
  department said.
      An additional 162,500 tonnes of wheat flour are still
  available to Iraq under the Export Enhancement Program
  initiative announced January 7, 1987, USDA said.
  

EGYPT AUTHORIZED TO BUY PL-480 WHEAT - USDA
  Egypt has been authorized to purchase
  about 200,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat under an existing PL-480
  agreement, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      It may buy the wheat, valued at 22.0 mln dlrs, between
  April 15 and August 31, 1987, and ship it from U.S. ports by
  September 30, the department said.
  

SOUTH KOREA CORN IMPORTS MAY INCREASE - USDA
  South Korea's purchase of about 2.4
  mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to
  double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the
  United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic
  jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
  said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season
  (Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln
  tonnes from the United States.
      During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln
  tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.
      Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in
  light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from
  China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.
  

USDA SEEKS COMMENTS ON GRAIN DISCOUNT SCHEDULE
  The U.S. Agriculture Department is
  seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the
  Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) discount and premium
  schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan
  collateral or under price support programs.
      The premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality
  factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. The
  schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing
  grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.
      The department said it is possible that producers could be
  encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjusting
  the premiums and discounts.
      Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress is
  required by law by May 10.
  

USDA DISCUSSING PL 480 AGREEMENT WITH MOROCCO
  The U.S. Agriculture Department is
  currently discussing an amendment to a PL 480 agreement signed
  with Morocco on January 22, but the mix of commodities under
  the amendment has not been determined, a U.S. Agriculture
  Department official said.
      The official noted the agreement signed in January provided
  for the supply of about 55,000 tonnes of vegetable oil, 55,000
  tonnes of corn and 126,000 tonnes of wheat, all for delivery
  during the current fiscal year, ending this September 30.
      No purchase authorizations for the commodities provided in
  the January agreement have been announced by the department.
  

JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT
  The Agriculture Ministry declined comment
  on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks
  on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.
      "We have no idea about the report and cannot comment," a
  spokesman told Reuters.
      Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,
  said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its
  intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for
  farm talks.
      The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue
  at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.
      Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff
  Control Act.
      Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about
  mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan
  will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is
  justified, it said.
      The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade
  round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.
  

CHINA'S WHEAT CROP THREATENED BY PESTS, DISEASE
  Pests and disease, which destroyed 1.1
  mln tonnes of wheat in China in 1986, are threatening crops on
  11.64 mln hectares this year, the China Daily said.
      About 14.54 mln hectares of wheat were affected in 1986.
      The paper said abnormal weather conditions had encouraged
  the spread of wheat midges in 2.47 mln hectares in Shanxi,
  Henan, Sichuan, Anhui, Hebei and Jiangsu.
      In Henan, Shandong and Hebei wheat aphids are affecting
  4.67 mln hectares, wheat red mite 2.8 mln hectares and wheat
  powdery mildew 1.7 mln hectares.
  

FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987
  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
  (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
  fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
      FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
  1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
  Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
      World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
  impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
  distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
      "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
  developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
  on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.
      FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
  a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
  harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
      FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
  upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of
  substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.
  

RPT - ARGENTINE GRAIN/OILSEED EXPORT PRICES ADJUSTED
  The Argentine Grain Board adjusted
  minimum export prices of grain and oilseed products in dlrs per
  tonne FOB, previous in brackets, as follows:
      Sorghum 64 (63), sunflowerseed cake and expellers 103 (102)
  , pellets 101 (100), meal 99 (98), linseed oil 274 (264),
  groundnutseed oil 450 (445), soybean oil 300 (290), rapeseed
  oil 290 (280).
      Sunflowerseed oil for shipment through May 323 (313) and
  june onwards 330 (320).
      The board also adjusted export prices at which export taxes
  are levied in dlrs per tonne FOB, previous in brackets, as
  follows:
      Bran pollard wheat 40 (42), pellets 42 (44).
  

LONDON FREIGHT MARKET FEATURES GRAIN OUT OF U.S.
  Moderately active grain fixing was
  reported out of the U.S. But none of the business involved the
  significant voyages to the Continent or Japan, ship brokers
  said.
      A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco
  and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to
  Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat
  flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500
  dlrs.
      Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against
  27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March.
      Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been
  booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav
  account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of
  oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation
  was obtainable.
      On the Continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from La
  Pallice to Buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from Ghent to
  Naples/Venice range. Elsewhere, maize from East London to Japan
  paid 22 dlrs.
      Soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and
  secured a 30,000 tonner from Savona for a trans-Atlantic round
  trip at 4,450 dlrs daily and a 31,000 tonner from
  Antwerp-Hamburg for a similar voyage at 4,250 dlrs daily.
  

INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88
  India's national foodgrain target has
  been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
  from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
  annual report for 1986/87.
      Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
  sub-divisions of the country.
      The report gave the targets for various crops with
  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
      Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
  growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
      The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
  total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
  mln.
     India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
  development plan ending March 31, 1990.
      Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
  than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
  good weather, the report said.
      "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
  (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
  vigrously pursued," it said.
  

EGYPT BUYS PL 480 WHEAT FLOUR - U.S. TRADERS
  Egypt bought 125,723 tonnes of U.S.
  wheat flour in its PL 480 tender yesterday, trade sources said.
      The purchase included 51,880 tonnes for May shipment and
  73,843 tonnes for June shipment. Price details were not
  available.
  

YUGOSLAVIA TO TENDER FOR 100,000 TONNES WHEAT
  Yugoslavia will tender April 14 for
  100,000 tonnes of wheat, the U.S. Agriculture Department's
  Counselor in Belgrade said in a field report.
      The report, dated April 7, said the wheat must be from 1986
  and 1987 harvest, and imports of soft wheat from Europe and
  from other suppliers will not be considered.
      It said the imports will be used to rebuild the federal
  reserves and as a result will not be subject to import
  surcharges.
  

FRENCH FREE MARKET CEREAL EXPORT BIDS DETAILED
  French operators have requested licences
  to export 320,000 tonnes of free market barley, 225,000 tonnes
  of maize, 25,000 tonnes of free market bread-making wheat and
  20,000 tonnes of feed wheat at today's EC tender, trade sources
  said.
      For the barley, rebates of between 138 and 141.25 European
  currency units (Ecus) per tonne were sought, for maize they
  were between 129.65 and 139 Ecus, for bread-making wheat around
  145 Ecus and for feed wheat around 142.45 Ecus.
      Barley rebates of up to 138.50 Ecus were requested for a
  total of 40,000 tonnes and at 139 Ecus for 85,000 tonnes.
      Rebates of up to 130 Ecus per tonne were requested for a
  total of 55,000 tonnes maize and up to 131 Ecus for 105,000
  tonnes, the sources said.

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT
  Based on field travel in the
  Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about
  average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.
      The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
  20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
      It said generally favorable weather from early December
  through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
      However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
  followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
  week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
  which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
  report said.
      The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
  serious storage problems, the report said.
      Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
  expected to be above average, it said.
      Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
  crop has been harvested.
      During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
  elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
  report said.
      New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana
  accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons
  for the decline are expected reduced government support price
  and good summer crop harvests.
  

EC COMMISSION AUTHORISED TO BUY MAIZE IN JUNE
  The European Commission was authorised
  to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores
  in the second half of June, although sales into intervention
  normally end on April 30, Commission sources said.
      They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals Management
  Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due
  to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC
  and the United States.
      The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for
  two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years.
      The sources said the intervention price for the maize would
  be 201.49 Ecus a tonne.
      They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full
      They added the decision is also designed to prevent massive
  offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal April
  30 deadline, which could be caused by speculation about the
  implementation of the accord with the United States.

EGYPT CANCELS WHEAT TENDER
  Egypt has cancelled its April 2 tender for
  200,000 tonnes of any origin wheat for April 15-30 shipment,
  trade and Egyptian official sources said.
      Trade sources said the cancellation followed an offer by an
  Egyptian company, Islamic Corp, at 85.80 dlrs/tonne cost and
  freight, undercutting other traders' offers of between 93.90
  and 94.49 dlrs/tonne.
      An Egyptian trade official in Paris confirmed cancellation
  of the tender following the Islamic Corp offer, which he said
  the government had refused for legal reasons.
      The official denied trade reports that the government might
  have substituted a private deal with Islamic Corp for the
  original tender.

ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION
  Italy's barley crop is generally in good
  condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the
  agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam
  said.
      First consignments were expected to be available around
  mid-June.
      Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of
  sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,
  which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop
  because of extreme dryness.
      Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low
  levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.
      Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national
  production would be around two pct higher than in the previous
  season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.
      If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved
  in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an
  increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.
  

CCC ACCEPTS BONUS ON BARLEY TO SAUDI ARABIA
  The Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC,

  Department said.
      The CCC accepted three bonus offers from one exporter which
  averaged 40.88 dlrs per tonne, it said.
      The barley is for delivery August 15-November 30 in three
  shiments of 50,000 tonnes each.
      The bonus awards were made to Louis Dreyfus Corporation and
  will be paid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks.
      An additional 350,000 tonnes of U.S. barley are still
  available to Saudi Arabia under the Export Enhancement Program
  initiative annnounced on May 15, 1987, it said.
  

EC REJECTS LICENCES FOR SPANISH BARLEY
  The EC Commission cereals management

  Spanish barley to non-EC countries, trade sources said.
      The licence requests were for 35,000 tonnes at between 143
  and 145 European Currency Units (ECUs), they said.
      This tender was part of a special tender for 500,000 tonnes
  of Spanish barley.
      The sources said there had been no bids for licences for
  free market soft wheat and non-Spanish barley exports to non-EC
  countries.
  

SASKATCHEWAN CROPS DETERIORATE IN HOT WEATHER
  Hot, dry weather has caused some
  deterioration in Saskatchewan crops, according to the
  Saskatchewan Wheat Pool's weekly crop report.
      Rain was needed in the southwest, west-central and
  northeast regions, and other regions were expected to need rain
  soon.
      Summerfallow crops were in fair to good condition, while
  stubble crops were rated fair to poor. Wheat, durum, oats and
  barley crops were all one-pct headed, rye was 40 pct in the
  milk stage and winter wheat was 21 pct milk stage.
      Flax was 51 pct tillering, and canola was 58 pct tillering.
      Areas of the southern grain belt were hit by high winds and
  hail Tuesday, with some damage reported.
  

DANISH CROPS TWO WEEKS BEHIND, OFFICIAL REPORT
  Danish crops are up to two weeks
  behind normal growth levels due to the cold weather in May and
  June, when mean temperatures were up to four centigrade below
  average, the State Plant Cultivation Bureau said in a report.
      At the season's first crop test on June 26, the bureau
  rated crops at an overall 94, the same as on June 20 last year.
  The figure of 100 represents normal in a year of average growth
  conditions with no crop damage.
      The test gave ratings expressed as a factor of 100, as
  follows - winter wheat 96 (last year 91), winter rye 97 (98),
  winter barley 92 (90), spring barley 94 (98), oats 96 (98),
  fodder and sugar beets 87 (96), winter rapeseed 98 (94), spring
  rapeseed 94 (98).
      Final harvest figures for 1986 were not yet available.
  

USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT
  Corn sales of 2,806,300 tonnes in
  the week ended March 19 were the highest level since
  mid-November, 1979, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The department said the USSR dominated the week's activity
  with purchases of 1.4 mln tonnes (which were earlier reported
  under the daily reporting system). Other large increaes were
  posted for Japan and unknown destinations, it said.
      Taiwan purchased 296,300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and
  170,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, it said.
      Wheat sales of 317,200 tonnes for the current season and
  125,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were down about one-third
  from the preceding week and the four-week average.
      Wheat sales to China of 60,000 tonnes were switched from
  1986/87 to the 1987/88 season, it noted.
      Soybean sales of 483,100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior
  week and two-thirds above the four-week average.
      Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico and Portugal were the main
  buyers, the department said.
      Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes were
  two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the
  marketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser.
      Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of
  4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more than
  offset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama,
  the department said.
      Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales for
  the current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season --
  were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the
  four-week average.
      Turkey, Thailand, South Korea and Canada were the major
  buyers for the current season, while Thailand, Britain and
  Japan were the major purchasers from the upcoming season, the
  department said.
       Sorghum sales of 178,800 tonnes were two-thirds above the
  prior week and 75 pct over the four-week average.
      Venezuela was the leading buyer it said.
      Sales of 41,800 tonnes of barley were 10 times the previous
  week and 10 pct greater than  the four-week average. Israel,
  Cyprus and Saudi Arabia were the main buyers, it said.
  

U.K. WHEAT AND BARLEY EXPORTS ADJUSTED UPWARDS
  The U.K. Exported 535,460 tonnes of wheat
  and 336,750 tonnes of barley in January, the Home Grown Cereals
  Authority (HGCA) said, quoting adjusted Customs and Excise
  figures.
      Based on the previous January figures issued on February 9,
  wheat exports increased by nearly 64,000 tonnes and barley by
  about 7,000 tonnes.
      The new figures bring cumulative wheat exports for the
  period July 1/February 13 to 2.99 mln tonnes, and barley to
  2.96 mln compared with 1.25 and 1.89 mln tonnes respectively a
  year ago.
      January wheat exports comprised 251,000 tonnes to European
  Community destinations and 284,000 tonnes to third countries.
      The Soviet Union was prominent in third country
  destinations, taking 167,700 tonnes while Poland was credited
  with 54,500 and South Korea 50,000 tonnes. Italy was the
  largest EC recipient with 75,000 tonnes followed by West
  Germany with 55,200 and France 52,000 tonnes.
      Barley exports for January comprised 103,700 tonnes to the
  EC and 233,000 to third countries. The Soviet Union was the

  Cereals Authority (HGCA) said.
      Based on the previous provisional figures issued for
  February, wheat exports were increased by 480,200 tonnes and
  barley by 283,800 tonnes.
      The new figures bring cumulative wheat exports for the
  period July 1-March 13 to 3.66 mln tonnes and barley to 3.50
  mln, compared with 1.47 and 2.09 mln tonnes respectively last
  season.
  

SOVIET UNION FEATURES IN U.K. GRAIN EXPORTS
  The Soviet Union featured prominently in
  U.K. Grain exports outside the EC for the period July 1/March
  13, taking a combined total of 1.10 mln tonnes of wheat and
  barley out of all-destination U.K. Exports of 7.16 mln tonnes,
  the Home Grown Cereals Authority said, quoting provisional
  Customs and Excise figures.
      The Soviet total comprises 634,000 tonnes of wheat and
  472,000 tonnes of barley. Grain traders said the figures
  understate shipments already made by several thousand tonnes
  and they expect total U.K. Grain exports to the USSR this
  season to reach 2.5 mln tonnes, comprising 1.5 mln wheat/1.0
  mln barley.

      As with the previous 64 EEP initiatives, sales of U.S.
  barley malt would be made to buyers in Colombia at competitive
  world prices, USDA said.
      The export sales would be subsidized with commodities from
  the inventory of the Commodity Credit Corp and enable U.S.
  exporters to compete at commercial prices in the Colombian
  market, USDA said.

ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC
  The size of French 1986/87 carryover
  barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with
  700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals
  Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.
      He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the
  end of February from the previous month while export forecasts
  were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.
      Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a
  larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are
  opened for French barley a large amount could be put into
  intervention.
      A small amount of French barley has already been put into
  intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.
      The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports
  to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000
  tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in
  1985/86.
      The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision
  to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.
  

U.K. GRAIN/POTATO FUTURES VOLUME DOWN IN FEBRUARY
  Traded volumes for U.K. Grain and potato
  futures in February were down on the previous month while

  EC GRANTS LICENCES FOR 35,000 TONNES  BARLEY AT 137.35 ECUS REBATE - BRUSSELS TRADE
  

EC COMMISSION GRANTS EXPORT LICENCES - TRADE
  The European Community's, EC, cereal
  management committee granted export licences for 5,000 tonnes
  of quality soft bread-making wheat at a maximum export rebate
  of 134.75 European currency units, Ecus, per tonne, traders
  said.
      The committee also granted export certificates of 35,000
  tonnes of barley at 137.35 Ecus per tonne, but rejected all
  bids for the export of soft feed wheat, they said.
      Certificates were also granted for the export of 15,000
  tonnes of maize at a maximum rebate of 132.90 Ecus per tonne,
  the traders said.

TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS
  French operators last Friday requested
  licences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950
  tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour to
  non-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,
  French trade sources said.
      The latest requests for the maize were for export to
  Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate
  prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20
  Ecu daily rebate.
      The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context
  of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the
  export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,
  in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent
  dispute over grain sales to Spain.
      If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,
  this will bring the total of French maize exported in this
  context to 25,500 tonnes.
      The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the
  sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.
      Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria
  and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed
  restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat
  flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an
  unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.
  

SRI LANKA GETS USDA APPROVAL FOR WHEAT PRICE
  Food Department officials said the U.S.
  Department of Agriculture approved the Continental Grain Co
  sale of 52,500 tonnes of soft wheat at 89 U.S. Dlrs a tonne C
  and F from Pacific Northwest to Colombo.
      They said the shipment was for April 8 to 20 delivery.
  

FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED
  Argentine grain producers adjusted
  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
  end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
      They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
      However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
      Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
      There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
      Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
  crops, including soybean.
      However, as the lands began drying later in the week
  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
      Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
      The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln.
      Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
      Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
  sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
      Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
  previously.
      This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
  tonnes.
      Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
      Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires in mid-April.
      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
  mln tonne crop.
      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
  7.1 mln.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
  sown in 1985/86.
      The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
  this were not available.
      Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
  will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
  not been as intense as in previous years.
  

HONDURAS SEEKING PL-480 BULK WHEAT APRIL 13

TUNISIA EXPECTED TO TENDER FOR FRENCH WHEAT
  Tunisia is expected to tender April 14 for
  100,000 tonnes of French soft wheat for delivery between May
  and August and which would be covered by the French export
  credit agency, COFACE, export credits, traders said here.
      No official tender has been announced yet by Tunisia, they
  said.
      France has sold a total of 200,000 tonnes of soft wheat to
  Tunisia since the begining of the current campaign which was
  covered by COFACE export credits. Of this amount, a total of
  150,000 tonnes was exported by March 1, they said.
  

CCC ACCEPTS EXPORT BID FOR WHEAT FLOUR TO IRAQ
  The Commodity Credit Corporation has
  accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover a sale of 12,500
  tonnes of wheat flour to Iraq, the U.S. AGriculture Department
  said.
      The bonus awarded was 113.0 dlrs per tonne and will be paid
  to Peavey Company in the form of commodities from CCC stocks.
      The wheat flour is for delivery May 15-June 15, 1987, the
  department said.
      An additional 162,500 tonnes of wheat flour are still
  available to Iraq under the Export Enhancement Program
  initiative announced January 7, 1987, USDA said.
  

EGYPT AUTHORIZED TO BUY PL-480 WHEAT - USDA
  Egypt has been authorized to purchase
  about 200,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat under an existing PL-480
  agreement, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      It may buy the wheat, valued at 22.0 mln dlrs, between
  April 15 and August 31, 1987, and ship it from U.S. ports by
  September 30, the department said.
  

USDA DISCUSSING PL 480 AGREEMENT WITH MOROCCO
  The U.S. Agriculture Department is
  currently discussing an amendment to a PL 480 agreement signed
  with Morocco on January 22, but the mix of commodities under
  the amendment has not been determined, a U.S. Agriculture
  Department official said.
      The official noted the agreement signed in January provided
  for the supply of about 55,000 tonnes of vegetable oil, 55,000
  tonnes of corn and 126,000 tonnes of wheat, all for delivery
  during the current fiscal year, ending this September 30.
      No purchase authorizations for the commodities provided in
  the January agreement have been announced by the department.
  

CHINA'S WHEAT CROP THREATENED BY PESTS, DISEASE
  Pests and disease, which destroyed 1.1
  mln tonnes of wheat in China in 1986, are threatening crops on
  11.64 mln hectares this year, the China Daily said.
      About 14.54 mln hectares of wheat were affected in 1986.
      The paper said abnormal weather conditions had encouraged
  the spread of wheat midges in 2.47 mln hectares in Shanxi,
  Henan, Sichuan, Anhui, Hebei and Jiangsu.
      In Henan, Shandong and Hebei wheat aphids are affecting
  4.67 mln hectares, wheat red mite 2.8 mln hectares and wheat
  powdery mildew 1.7 mln hectares.
  

FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987
  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
  (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
  fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
      FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
  1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
  Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
      World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
  impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
  distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
      "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
  developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
  on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.
      FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
  a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
  harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
      FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
  upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of
  substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.
  

RPT - ARGENTINE GRAIN/OILSEED EXPORT PRICES ADJUSTED
  The Argentine Grain Board adjusted
  minimum export prices of grain and oilseed products in dlrs per
  tonne FOB, previous in brackets, as follows:
      Sorghum 64 (63), sunflowerseed cake and expellers 103 (102)
  , pellets 101 (100), meal 99 (98), linseed oil 274 (264),
  groundnutseed oil 450 (445), soybean oil 300 (290), rapeseed
  oil 290 (280).
      Sunflowerseed oil for shipment through May 323 (313) and
  june onwards 330 (320).
      The board also adjusted export prices at which export taxes
  are levied in dlrs per tonne FOB, previous in brackets, as
  follows:
      Bran pollard wheat 40 (42), pellets 42 (44).
  

INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88
  India's national foodgrain target has
  been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
  from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
  annual report for 1986/87.
      Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
  sub-divisions of the country.
      The report gave the targets for various crops with
  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
      Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
  growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
      The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
  total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
  mln.
     India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
  development plan ending March 31, 1990.
      Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
  than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
  good weather, the report said.
      "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
  (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
  vigrously pursued," it said.
  

EGYPT BUYS PL 480 WHEAT FLOUR - U.S. TRADERS
  Egypt bought 125,723 tonnes of U.S.
  wheat flour in its PL 480 tender yesterday, trade sources said.

  available.
  

YUGOSLAVIA TO TENDER FOR 100,000 TONNES WHEAT
  Yugoslavia will tender April 14 for
  100,000 tonnes of wheat, the U.S. Agriculture Department's
  Counselor in Belgrade said in a field report.
      The report, dated April 7, said the wheat must be from 1986
  and 1987 harvest, and imports of soft wheat from Europe and
  from other suppliers will not be considered.
      It said the imports will be used to rebuild the federal
  reserves and as a result will not be subject to import
  surcharges.
  

FRENCH FREE MARKET CEREAL EXPORT BIDS DETAILED
  French operators have requested licences
  to export 320,000 tonnes of free market barley, 225,000 tonnes
  of maize, 25,000 tonnes of free market bread-making wheat and
  20,000 tonnes of feed wheat at today's EC tender, trade sources
  said.
      For the barley, rebates of between 138 and 141.25 European
  currency units (Ecus) per tonne were sought, for maize they
  were between 129.65 and 139 Ecus, for bread-making wheat around
  145 Ecus and for feed wheat around 142.45 Ecus.
      Barley rebates of up to 138.50 Ecus were requested for a
  total of 40,000 tonnes and at 139 Ecus for 85,000 tonnes.
      Rebates of up to 130 Ecus per tonne were requested for a
  total of 55,000 tonnes maize and up to 131 Ecus for 105,000
  tonnes, the sources said.
  

EC GRANTS FREE MARKET BARLEY, MAIZE EXPORTS
  The European Commission authorised the
  export of 65,000 tonnes of free market barley at today's tender
  at a maximum rebate of 138.75 European currency units and
  55,000 tonnes of French maize at 130 Ecus, grain traders here
  said.
      It rejected bids for breadmaking and feed wheat, they said.
  

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT
  Based on field travel in the
  Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about
  average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.
      The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
  20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
      It said generally favorable weather from early December
  through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
      However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
  followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
  week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
  which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
  report said.
      The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
  serious storage problems, the report said.
      Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
  expected to be above average, it said.
      Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
  crop has been harvested.
      During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
  elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
  report said.
      New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana
  accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons
  for the decline are expected reduced government support price
  and good summer crop harvests.

EGYPT CANCELS WHEAT TENDER
  Egypt has cancelled its April 2 tender for
  200,000 tonnes of any origin wheat for April 15-30 shipment,
  trade and Egyptian official sources said.
      Trade sources said the cancellation followed an offer by an
  Egyptian company, Islamic Corp, at 85.80 dlrs/tonne cost and
  freight, undercutting other traders' offers of between 93.90
  and 94.49 dlrs/tonne.
      An Egyptian trade official in Paris confirmed cancellation
  of the tender following the Islamic Corp offer, which he said
  the government had refused for legal reasons.
      The official denied trade reports that the government might
  have substituted a private deal with Islamic Corp for the
  original tender.

SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA
  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
  Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
      In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
  USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
  Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
  month.
      USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"
  because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
      All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
  USDA said.
      Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
  mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
  miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
      USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
  through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
      The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above
  average winter-kill," USDA said.
      Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
  maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
  grain recently.
      USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
  grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
  and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.
  


USDA REPORTS EXPORT SALES ACTIVITY
  The U.S. Agriculture Department said
  private U.S. exporters reported sales of 200,000 tonnes of
  wheat to Jordan, 300,000 tonnes of soybean meal to Iraq and
  100,000 tonnes of corn to Algeria.
      The wheat for Jordan includes 165,000 tonnes of hard red
  winter and 35,000 tonnes of soft red winter and is for delivery
  during the 1987/88 marketing year.
      The soybean meal sales to Iraq includes 180,000 tonnes for
  delivery during the 1986/87 season and 120,000 tonnes during
  the 1987/88 season, the department said.
      The 100,000 tonnes of corn sales to Algeria are for
  delivery during the 1986/87 season, it said.
      The marketing year for wheat begins June 1, corn September
  1, and soybean meal October 1.
  

EXPORT BONUS WHEAT FOR JORDAN --USDA
  The Commodity Credit Corporation
  (CCC) accepted eight bonus offers from two exporters on sales
  of 190,000 tonnes of hard red winter and 35,000 tonnes of soft
  red winter wheat to Jordan, the U.S. Agriculture Department
  said.
      The department said the bonuses awarded averaged 38.08 dlrs
  per tonne and the wheat is for delivery May-November, 1987.
      The bonus awards were made to Louis Dreyfus Corp (200,000 
  tonnes), and Continental Grain Co (25,000 tonnes) and will be
  paid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks.
      The purchases of U.S. wheat completes the Export
  Enhancement Program initiative announced on December 31, 1986.
  


ARGENTINE GRAIN MARKET REVIEW
  The Argentine grain market was
  quiet in the week to Wednesday, with prices rising slightly on
  increased interest in wheat, millet and birdseed.
      Wheat for domestic consumption rose six Australs per tonne
  to 118.
      For export it rose eight to 108 per tonne from Bahia
  Blanca, increased 0.50 to 104 at Necochea and was unchanged at
  Rosario at 108.30.
      Maize increased one to 90 per tonne at Buenos Aires, was
  unchanged at 82 in Bahia Blanca, increased 0.50 to 85 at
  Necochea and fell one to 88 at Parana River ports.
      Sorghum from Bahia Blanca increased 0.50 Australs to 76.50
  per tonne and dropped one to 75 at Rosario.
      It was quoted at 75 at Villa Constitucion, San Nicolas and
  Puerto Alvear.
      Oats were unchanged at 168 per tonne at Buenos Aires.
      Millet from Buenos Aires and Rosario rose five per tonne to
  140 and birdseed rose 15 to 205 at Buenos Aires.
  

AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS
  Australia could lose valuable wheat
  markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
  coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
  Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
      "If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
  true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
  valuable markets," he said in a statement.
      Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
  spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
  farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
  back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
      However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
  cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
  facing enormous financial pressures.
      He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
  hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
  16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
  intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
      If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
  plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
  with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
  wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
      "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
  understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
  will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
  decrease production," Condon said.
      "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
  income earner, governments and government authorities will need
  to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
  viability of the wheat industry," he added.
      Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,
  Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.
  

THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER
  Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
  billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
  year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up
  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.
  

JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.
  Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
  U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
  tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
  a senior ministry official said.
      "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
  by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,
  said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
  its farm import market," he said.
      Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
  protect local farmers.
      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
  beef accord next March 31.
      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
  some one billion dlrs in new business.
      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
  industrial sector.
      "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
  issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official
  said.
  

GATT OFFICIAL MEETS WITH U.S. FARM LEADERS
  The official in charge of
  agricultural matters in the new round of global trade talks is
  in Washington today and tomorrow to meet with congressional and
  Reagan administration officials.
      Aart de Zeeuw, chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morning
  with members of the House Agriculture Committee.
      Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern over
  protectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakers
  noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan
  rates, committee staff said.
      "Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loan
  rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally," one source
  said.
      De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration with
  Japan's restrictive rice import policy, and members defended
  the U.S. dairy policy, which aims to cut surplus production by
  subsidizing producers to trim herds, sources said.
      Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture
  members and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis.
      Tomorrow, De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and Means
  Trade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, before
  visiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.
      De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week. His trip to North
  America is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders in
  the key GATT member states.
      The negotiating group on agriculture held its first meeting
  in February and is expected to meet again in May.
  

JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT
  The Agriculture Ministry declined comment
  on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks
  on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.
      "We have no idea about the report and cannot comment," a
  spokesman told Reuters.
      Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,
  said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its
  intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for
  farm talks.
      The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue
  at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.
      Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff
  Control Act.
      Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about
  mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan
  will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is
  justified, it said.
      The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade
  round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.
  

INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88
  India's national foodgrain target has
  been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
  from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
  annual report for 1986/87.
      Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
  sub-divisions of the country.
      The report gave the targets for various crops with
  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
      Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
  growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
      The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
  total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
  mln.
     India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
  development plan ending March 31, 1990.
      Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
  than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
  good weather, the report said.
      "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
  (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
  vigrously pursued," it said.
  

THAI RICE EXPORTS FALL IN WEEK TO APRIL 7
  Thailand exported 56,652 tonnes of rice
  in the week ended April 7, down from 75,160 tonnes the previous
  week, the Commerce Ministry said.
      It said the government and private exporters shipped 41,607
  and 15,045 tonnes respectively.
      Private exporters concluded advance weekly sales for 48,062
  tonnes against 22,086 tonnes the previous week.
      Thailand exported 1.29 mln tonnes of rice so far in 1987,
  down from 1.39 mln tonnes a year ago.
      It has commitments to export a further 353,045 tonnes this
  year.
  

DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS
  A prolonged dry spell has damaged
  111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces
  in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials
  said.
      They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce
  estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of
  rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing
  conditions continued until next month.
      Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the
  losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in
  other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry
  spell.
      Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),
  representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8
  mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.
      About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at
  170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.
      Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been
  hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total
  thus the damage is considered negligible.
      In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by
  production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified
  into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.
       The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production
  in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to
  320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no
  reports of actual damage.
  

CHINA RAISES GRAIN PURCHASE PRICES
  China has raised the state purchase
  prices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April
  1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official China
  Commercial Daily said.
      The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northern
  provinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50
  kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the
  price to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.
      The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10
  southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.
      The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11
  provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest
  China has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no
  more price details.
      It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price
  increases before farmers begin planting, to encourage
  production of grains and oilseeds.
      Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow
  grain because they can earn more from other crops.
  

CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES FOR RICE TO ALGERIA - USDA
  The Commodity Credit Corporation,
  CCC, has authorized 3.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees for sales
  of U.S. rice to Algeria for fiscal year 1987 under the Export
  Credit Guarantee Program, GSM-102, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      The additional guarantees increase the cumulative fiscal
  year 1987 program for sales of U.S. agricultural products to
  Algeria to 469.0 mln dlrs.
      To be eligible for the credit guarantee coverage, all sales
  under the new line must be registered and exported by September
  30, 1987, the department aid.
  

LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware
  his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus
  markets is likely to be rejected.
       But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to
  Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an
  international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import
  protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open
  its markets.
      "(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but
  they are not going to give us anything," Lyng said.
      U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions
  during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions
  would be unveiled later this month, they said.
      "If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him," when he
  visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.
      Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by
  partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
      A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week
  requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
  such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
  Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
      Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
  beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
  like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
      He cited the example of a California company which
  transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
  circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
  the value of the animal, he said.
      U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
  Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
  from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
  quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan
  has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
      Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
  eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
  April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
  be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
  liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
  mandarin orange industry.
      The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
  imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And
  Japanese officials have said.
     Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy
  surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
  but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.
     Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,
  including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in
  Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
  minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.
  

BOMB THREATS, STRIKES AS FIJI SEES END TRADE BAN
  Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade
  ban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the
  country's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure
  for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.
      The government welcomed a decision by the Australian
  Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to
  Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected
  government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.
      The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,
  fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union
  decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice
  and wheat from an Australian port, the government said.
      Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugar
  industry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.
      In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the
  Australian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be
  a hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience
  to press for his reinstatement.
  

INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS
  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak."
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  "strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of "over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations."

AGENCY HEAD SAYS JAPAN SHOULD CUT RICE PRICE
  The government should cut its consumer
  rice price if the official producer price is reduced next
  month, Tetsuo Kondo, director general of the government's
  Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told reporters.
      Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should
  receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due
  to the strong yen and lower oil prices.
      Agriculture Ministry sources said the producer rice price
  paid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the Rice
  Price Council, an advisory body to the ministry, on July 1 and
  2. The consumer rice price is usually set in December.
  

GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT
  Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize
  imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,
  the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.
      Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey
  made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes
  of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid
  programme.
      The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows
  government concern over "lower than average rainfall in southern
  Ghana and its implications for the major harvest."
      Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing
  areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of
  Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all
  major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
      GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences
  of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought
  experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to
  alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
      The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously
  affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts
  of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have
  dried up.
  

CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR REALLOCATED
  The Commodity Credit Corporation
  (CCC) has reallocated 1.3 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
  originally granted to cover the sale of protein meals to El
  Salvador so it may buy rice, the U.S. Agriculture Department
  said.
      The action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales
  of protein meals to 12.7 mln dlrs and creates a rice credit
  guarantee line of 1.3 mln dlrs, the department said.
      All sales under the credit guarantee lines must be
  registered and exports completed by September 30, the
  department said.
  

PAKISTAN ALLOWS PRIVATE COTTON, RICE EXPORTS
  The Pakistani government allowed the
  private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy
  announced to cover the next three years.
      Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
  televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import
  of cotton yarn.
      Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
  1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and
  rice along with the state corporations.
      He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make
  high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and
  to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This
  would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.
  

PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS
  Pakistani government allowed freer
  cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
  at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
      Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
  televised speech the government had also decided to allow
  duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
  more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
  Pakistani products.
     
      Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
  1970s.
      But Haq said now the private sector would also export
  cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
  long-standing demand of the local traders.
      The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
  bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
  compete effectively in the world market, he said.
     
      Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
  reviewed every year.
      It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
  trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
  enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
  longer period.
      He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
  for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
  countries on soft credit terms.
     
      Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
  cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
  billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
      He said the government policy was to rationalise and
  streamline import controls.
      "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
  specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
  industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," he
  said. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
  produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
  to smuggling and hampering of exports."
     
      He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
  from import restrictions.
      Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
  remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
  Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
  drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
  balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.
  

RICE RESEARCH INSTITUTE NAMES NEW HEAD
  The Manila-based International Rice
  Research Institute (IRRI) said West German agricultural
  scientist Klaus Lampe will take over as its director-general in
  early 1988, succeeding M.S. Swaminathan.
      An IRRI statement said Lampe, 56, is currently senior
  adviser to the German Agency for Technical Cooperation at
  Eschborn and was a former head of the agriculture section of
  the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation.
      It said Swaminathan, who has headed IRRI since 1982, will
  concentrate on environmental and agricultural issues.
  

THAI RICE EXPORTS RISE IN WEEK TO OCTOBER 13
  Thai rice exports rose to 72,987 tonnes
  in the week ended October 13 from 54,075 the previous week, the
  Commerce Ministry said.
      It said the government and private exporters shipped 26,272
  and 46,715 tonnes respectively. Private exporters concluded
  advance weekly sales for 106,640 tonnes against 98,152 the
  previous week. The said it ministry expects at least 65,000
  tonnes in exports next week.
      Thailand has shipped 3.43 mln tonnes of rice in the year to
  date, down from 3.68 mln a year ago. It has commitments to
  export another 388,390 tonnes this year.
  

JAMAICA BUYS U.S. PL-480 CORN, WHEAT AND RICE
  Jamaica bought U.S. corn, wheat and
  rice at its tender earlier this week using PL-480 funds, a U.S.
  Department of Agriculture official said.
      The purchase consisted of the following cargoes -
   - Cargill sold 1,503.5 tonnes of number two soft red winter
  (SRW) wheat for May 5/30 shipment at 117.44 dlrs per tonne FOB
  Gulf ports.
   - Continental Grain 8,250 tonnes of number two northern
  spring/dark northern spring (NS/DNS) wheat (14.5 pct protein)
  for April 15/May 10 at 123.97 dlrs FOB Gulf, excluding
  Brownsville.
   - Nichemen 10,000 tonnes number two SRW wheat for June 12/July
  7 at 103.43 dlrs FOB Gulf.
   - Nichemen 10,000 tonnes number two NS/DNS wheat (14.0 pct
  protein) for May 25/June 20 at 121.89 dlrs FOB Gulf.
   - Cargill 10,000 tonnes number two SRW wheat for April 10/May
  5 at 120.88 dlrs FOB Gulf.
   - Cargill 8,469.5 tonnes number two SRW wheat for May 5/30 at
  117.44 dlrs FOB Gulf.
   - Louis Dreyfus 4,500 tonnes number three yellow corn (15.0
  pct maximum moisture) for April 10/May 5 at 76.09 dlrs FOB
  Gulf.
   - Louis Dreyfus 5,300 tonnes same corn April 20/May 15 at
  75.89 dlrs FOB Gulf.
   - Louis Dreyfus 5,300 tonnes same corn May 10/June 5 at 75.49
  dlrs FOB Gulf.
   - Louis Dreyfus 5,300 tonnes same corn June 1/25 at 75.49 dlrs
  FOB Gulf.
   - Loius Dreyfus 3,700 tonnes number two yellow corn (14.5 pct
  maximum moisture) for Apirl 10/May 5 at 76.29 dlrs FOB Gulf.
   - Louis Dreyfus 3,700 tonnes same corn for May 10/June 5 at
  75.68 dlrs FOB Gulf.
      Exporters have not received final PL-480 approval on their
  sale of a total of 9,500 tonnes of U.S. number five or better
  long grain brown rice (10 pct maximum broken) for April 10/May
  25 shipments.
      But the USDA official said he saw no hold-up in obtaining
  that approval.
  

SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID
  Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries
  for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the
  country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.
      Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid
  needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.
      The letter said the government had to step in "to avert
  serious economic hardship" and because the Social Services
  Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision
  of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.
      The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six
  month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop
  was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and
  other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of
  sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.
      In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha
  (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completely
  devastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was now
  estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally
  expected.
      There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high
  forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate
  rainfall within the next three to four weeks.
      "Should the present drought continue, however, production is
  estimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added.
      Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90
  and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last
  year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.
      The letter said villagers in most seriously affected
  districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because
  subsidiary crops had also failed.
      It said the government's current budget did not permit it
  to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.
  "Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity
  prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue
  to exert pressure on the expenditure side."
      The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per
  month for each family, as well as handling, transport and
  distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by
  the government would not be possible without seriously
  impairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation"
  in the economy, the letter said.
      The letter said the Food Department would be able to
  release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the
  immediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replaced
  subsequently."
      The Meteorological Department said the country was
  experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month
  dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when
  the monsoon rains fell in late May.
      The letter said some areas had been experiencing the
  drought since August, and in the rice growing district of
  Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June
  1986.
  

DROUGHT THREAT EASES IN SOUTH CHINA PROVINCE
  Rainfall in the past few days has eased
  the threat of drought in the south China province of Guangdong,
  the New China News Agency said.
      It said 75 pct of early rice fields are ready to be planted
  and seedlings have already been transplanted on 90 pct of rice
  fields in Hainan island. Some 840,000 hectares of farmland have
  been planted with cash crops including sugar cane, peanuts and
  soybeans, 67,000 ha more than in 1986.
      The provincial government has increased investment in grain
  and taken effective measures to combat natural disasters this
  year, the agency said, but gave no further details.
  

CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA
  Moderate to heavy rain continued
  over early double-crop rice areas in eastern Guangxi,
  Guanghdong, eastern Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang in the
  week ended March 28, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of
  the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.
      In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency
  said The moisture lessened the need for irrigation. Moisture
  for early rice planting is adequate to abundant in most areas,
  and inundative rain in Guangdong and southern Jiangxi may have
  washed out some rice fields requiring replanting.
       Light showers in southern Sichuan increased topsoil
  moisture for corn planting, which likely is off to a slow start
  due to earlier dryness, it said.
      In the North China Plain, dry weather covered winter wheat
  in the vegetative stage, and rain is needed to meet increasing
  crop moisture requirements, it said.
      Weekly temperatures in the North China Plain were near
  normal, the agency noted.
  

USDA AGAIN EXTENDS FARM OPERATING PLAN DEADLINE
  The U.S. Agriculture Department said
  it has extended until April 17 the date by which Agricultural
  Stabilization and Conservation county offices must determine
  eligibility of individuals or other entities for payments under
  1987 farm programs.
      Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and Rice
  Price Support Division, said the decision meant farmers have
  until April 17 to file a farm operating plan indicating how
  many persons would be involved in their farming operations.
      Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1
  from March 1, Sitter said.
      ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement that
  the extension was necessary because of heavy workloads at
  county ASCS offices.
      Hertz said ASCS county officials "have had to make a large
  number of eligibility determinations for individuals and other
  entities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparation
  for imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap."
      "These offices already had a very heavy workload due to the
  large number of applications for both the 1987 farm programs
  and the Conservation Reserve Program," Hertz said.
  

CCC CREDITS FOR MEXICO SWITCHED TO WHEAT--USDA
  The Commodity Credit Corporation
  (CCC) has switched 10 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to Mexico
  to cover purchases of U.S. wheat, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      The credit guarantees were previously earmarked for sales
  of U.S. dry edible beans and rice, it said.
      The action reduces the guarantee lines previously
  authorized of dry edible beans to by five mln dlrs to 45 mln
  dlrs and for rice from five mln to zero and increases coverage
  for wheat sales from five mln to 15 mln dlrs.
  

LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA
  Rising demand for U.S. rice may
  gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help
  increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite
  sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the
  department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the
  1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln
  hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on
  July 31.
      Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is
  expected to decline this year, the report said.
      USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain
  acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain
  relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential
  has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields
  relative to those of other classes have leveled off.
      With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the
  marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a
  faster rate, USDA said.
      "Development of new products and increased promotion have
  helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of
  consumers," USDA said.
      USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because
  of large production and stocks but a weaker market should
  affect competing exporters more than the U.S.
      "The United States has already recovered a substantial share
  of the European Community market and made inroads into markets
  in the Middle East and Africa," the report said.
      World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels
  in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,
  increased domestic production and low import prices have
  allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse
  grains.
      China, India and South Korea have increased output, while
  the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the
  mid-1970s, the report said.
  

TURKEY ELIGIBLE FOR U.S. BONUS RICE
  The U.S. Agriculture Department said
  Turkey has been made eligible for the sale of up to 70,000
  tonnes of medium grain milled rice under the department's
  export enhancement program, EEP.
      As with the 65 previous EEP initiatives, the export sales
  would be subsidized with commodities from the inventory of the
  Commodity Credit Corp and made at competitive world prices,
  USDA said.
  

THAI RICE EXPORTS FALL IN WEEK TO MARCH 31
  Thailand exported 75,160 tonnes of rice
  in the week ended March 31, down from 88,785 tonnes the
  previous week, the Commerce Ministry said.
      It said the government and private exporters shipped 36,552
  and 38,608 tonnes respectively.
      Private exporters concluded advance weekly sales for 22,086
  tonnes against 44,483 tonnes the previous week.
      Thailand exported 1.23 mln tonnes of rice in January/March,
  down from 1.29 mln tonnes a year ago. It has commitments to
  export another 381,171 tonnes this year.
  

USDA ANNOUNCES WORLD MARKET RICE PRICES
  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  announced the following prevailing world market prices of rice
  on a loan-rate basis, with previous prices --
      -- Long grain whole kernels 5.87 cts per lb vs 5.70
      -- Medium grain whole kernels 5.28 cts per lb vs 5.12
      -- Short grain whole kernels  5.22 cts per lb vs 5.06
      -- Broken kernels 2.94 cts per lb vs 2.85
      The repayment rate for 1986-crop warehouse or farm-stored
  rice loans are the higher of the world price or 50 pct of the
  loan rate of 7.20 dlrs per cwt.
      The prices will remain in effect for a week, but new prices
  could be announced earlier if warranted, USDA said.
  

U.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS
  Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he
  intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers
  of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92
  pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they
  planted.
      Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that
  applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was
  supported by the Reagan administration and would save
  approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn
  payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.
      The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the
  Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of
  Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House
  Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.
      Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.
  Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency
  payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not
  to plant under the decoupling scheme.
      If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market
  prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished
  deficiency payments.
      Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
  said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as
  possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter
  further before deciding how he would vote on it.
  

USDA WOULD SCRAP COTTON, RICE, BEAN PRICE FLOORS
  The package of proposed farm policy
  changes that the Reagan administration sent to Congress today
  includes a provision that would eliminate minimum price support
  levels for upland cotton, rice and soybeans.
      The package, obtained by Reuters, also includes a
  provision, outlined in advance by USDA officials, that would
  increase the annual permissible cut in the basic price support
  levels for all major crops to 10 pct from five pct.
      Under current law, the basic support prices for upland
  cotton, rice and soybeans between 1987 and 1990 cannot be cut
  below 50 cents per lb, 6.50 dlrs per hundredweight and 4.50
  dlrs per bushel, respectively.
      USDA's intention to propose scrapping price floors for
  cotton, rice and soybeans had not been disclosed previously.
  

THAILAND REDUCES MAIN RICE CROP PROJECTION
  Thailand's main paddy crop is expected
  to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season from
  a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35
  mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said.
      It said a joint field survey late last month by the
  association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand
  indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is
  lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces.
      The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon
  Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were
  especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of
  1986.
      It said last November that the drought reduced total
  national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this
  year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.
      The main crop represents about 85 pct of Thailand's paddy
  output.
  

THAI RICE EXPORTS RISE IN WEEK ENDED FEBRUARY 24
  Thailand exported 84,960 tonnes of rice
  in the week ended February 24, up from 80,498 the previous
  week, the Commerce Ministry said.
      It said government and private exporters shipped 27,510 and
  57,450 tonnes respectively.
      Private exporters concluded advance weekly sales for 79,448
  tonnes against 79,014 the previous week.
      Thailand exported 689,038 tonnes of rice between the
  beginning of January and February 24, up from 556,874 tonnes
  during the same period last year. It has commitments to export
  another 658,999 tonnes this year.
  

INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW
  Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow
  by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
  in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
  declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
      Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to
  fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
  26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
  Indonesia"s agricultural performance.
      The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
  26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
  1987.
      The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
  tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
  a drawdown on stocks.
      "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
  promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
  production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
  gain," the report says.
      "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
  to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
  and palm kernels."
      Constraints to significant overall increases in
  agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
  seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
  farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
  report underlines.
      The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
  pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
  largely offset gains in yields.
      The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
  insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
  resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
  resistant rice types.
      The government is depending on increased production of
  export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
  palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
  oil prices.
      Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
  in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
  to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
  report says.
      But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
  rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
  also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
      The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
  meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
  September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
  in domestic demand.
      The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic
  performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
  negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
  mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
  in 1984.
      The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
  for the slump.
  

ASCS BUYS PROCESSED PRODUCTS FOR DOMESTIC USE
  The Agricultural Stabilization and
  Conservation Service (ASCS) bought 25.7 mln pounds of wheat
  flour at a cost of 2.8 mln dlrs for domestic shipment April
  1-15 and April 16-30, an ASCS spokesman said.
      ASCS also bought 11.1 mln pounds of bakers flour for 1.1
  mln dlrs, 1.9 mln pounds of pasta for 408,258 dlrs, 1.4 mln
  pounds of processed cereal products for 304,043 dlrs, 4.8 mln
  pounds of corn products for 474,944 dlrs, and 16.3 mln pounds
  of milled rice for 2.0 mln dlrs.
  

BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES SOON AFTER TOKYO OPENING
  The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of
  dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen, dealers
  said.
      The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house
  sold dollars, putting pressure on the U.S. Currency, they said.
      The dollar was also supported by a major electrical
  consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at
  around 145.25 yen, they added.
      The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New
  York and 145.25 at the close here yesterday.
  

JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING
  The leaders of two of Japan's top business
  groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
  accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
  Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
  yen's current level as appropriate.
      Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
  Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
  above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
      Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
  Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
  from rising further.
      "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
  the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
  said.
      G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.
  And West Germany said in a statement they consider their
  currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
  economic fundamentals.
      Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to
  intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange
  rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.
  

MIYAZAWA SAYS YEN STILL INSIDE PARIS RANGE
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
  Miyazawa said the strengthening of the yen against the dollar
  that has occurred since the Paris Agreement was within the
  range agreed on in the Louvre discussions.
      "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
  discussions in Paris," Miyazawa told a press conference
  following the Group of Seven meeting here.
      He added that the current discussions were a "reaffirmation"
  of that agreement, indicating that the "solidarity" that occurred
  in Paris was still in place.
  

YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  The yen is likely to start another
  uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies
  because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new,
  currency and bond analysts here said.
      "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that," said
  one trader at a major Wall Street securities company.
      Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: "The
  market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."
      The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days
  just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying
  bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting
  of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven
  industrialized nations in Washington.
      After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a
  communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's
  view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent
  with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability
  should be fostered around these levels.
      The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.
      "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with
  fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line
  when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?," asked
  Republic's Cohen.
      Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled
  speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are
  prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is
  still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.
      Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the
  key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the
  authorities' permissible range.
      Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would
  probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop
  up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market
  intervention and public comments.
      Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of
  Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of
  dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.
      The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively
  selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade
  data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion
  dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.

U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS
  The United States, which has long
  sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
  satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and
  allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
  to stabilize currencies.
      Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced
  yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.
      But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
  powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
  the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.
      And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far
  East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that
  currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the
  countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point
  despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.
      Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the
  movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading
  ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.
      "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
  discussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.
      The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
  announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of
  Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's
  meetings of leading industrial nations.
      In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action
  "extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris
  Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
  broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
      The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West
  Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore
  repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
  foster exchange rate stability.
      The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
  bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
  dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
  intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
  years. Monetary sources also said they understood that
  Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely
  successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.
      They also said there was a growing feeling among the
  finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
  medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
  differences in past meetings.
      West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
  the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of
  yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
  countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
      Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that
  major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
  between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's
  trade deficit have already taken place.
      No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut
  the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
  reafffirmation of Paris.
      European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are
  essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that
  reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
      A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this
  week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further
  sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose
  substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
  undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.
      Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
  politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.
      Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany
  welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
  currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.
      Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak
  dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the
  Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.
      The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
  their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian
  Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.
      Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit
  to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
      The United States and France, backed by the International
  Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a
  limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
  inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
  account balances.
      Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
  consultations between the countries on whether corrective
  action should be required.
      But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
  has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it
  implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
      The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully
  sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
  currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.
      The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
  of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
  relatively free currency markets of recent years.

NAKASONE SAYS DOLLAR FALL ONLY TEMPORARY
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said the
  dollar's sharp fall against the yen overnight was only
  temporary.
      The dollar dropped sharply in New York after news that Paul
  Volcker would step down as chairman of the U.S. Federal
  Reserve.
      Nakasone told reporters he did not expect U.S. Policy to
  change after Volcker steps down.
  

JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS
  Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
  value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And
  other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
  advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency
  (EPA) said.
      The advisory body said in its report that the yen would
  soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
  basis were delayed.
      An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to
  slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to
  restructure their economies.
      The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
  Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
  product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change
  would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
  during the seven-year period to 1993.
      If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's
  current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This
  scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.
      It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
  and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.

LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS
  The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
  still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
  currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
      And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
  weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
  range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
  Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
      "The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
  anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
  later on," the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
      The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
  dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
  noted.
      A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
  monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
  never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
  against the mark or the yen.
      The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
  140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
      The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
  141.35 yen.
      "Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
  interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
  does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
  of the Louvre accord," the Finance Ministry official said.
      He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
  further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
  hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
  problem.
      Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
  interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
  further, the monetary officials said.
      Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
  to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
  decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
  expectations in the U.S.
      "That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
  agreement is still operative," the senior ministry official
  said.
      Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
  Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
  Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
      The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
  Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
  decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
  try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
  accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
      But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
  statement that "the Louvre agreement is still operative," and
  this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
  dealers said.
      Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
  Tokyo currency markets.
      The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
  pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
  higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
  or international economic policy coordination.
      The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
  France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
  economic policies and from time to time apply "peer pressure" to
  persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
  they noted. "Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
  surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
  policy so openly," the ministry official said.
      The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
  should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
  coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
  of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
      He also said Japan has not received any specific request
  from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
  money rates have been edging higher.
      "This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
  policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
  rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons," he
  added.
  

TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN
  Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching
  nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the
  significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
      "The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
  considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
  currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,"
  said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
  Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
      The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
  closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
      The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
  140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
  and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
      The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
      "The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
  sentiment after Baker's comments," said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
  said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
  the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
  Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
      The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
  drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
  in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
      Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
  strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
  rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
  with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
  due to their fears of increasing inflation.
      Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
  pressures also slow domestic demand.
      West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
  boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
  deficit, Tanaka said.
      U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
  massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
  rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
      "Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
  coordinate dollar buying intervention," said Soichi Hirabayashi,
  deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
  department.
      The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally
  considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
      "The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
  future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations
  failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre
  accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,"
  Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low
  as 135 yen soon.
  

JAPAN SETS ASIDE YEN FUNDS TO PREVENT DLR FALL
  The 50-day provisional 1987/88 budget,
  adopted today by the government, allows the Finance Ministry to
  issue up to 14,600 billion yen worth of foreign exchange fund
  financing bills, government sources said.
      Foreign exchange dealers said the yen funds would be used
  to buy dollars, to prevent a further dollar fall.
      The government sources said the amount, covering the first
  50 days of the year starting April 1, accounts for more than 90
  pct of the 16,000 billion yen in bills incorporated in the full
  budget.

G-6 WANTS TO HOLD DLR ABOVE 150 YEN - NAKASONE
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said
  that Japan and other industrialized nations committed
  themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above
  150 yen.
      He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that
  the six nations have taken measures, including market
  intervention, to support the dollar above that level.
      Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee
  that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
  West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar
  fell below 150 yen.
      Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize
  exchange rates.
      Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of
  each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did
  not think the fundamentals themselves had changed
  substantially.
      But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is
  happening in major nations. He did not elaborate.
      Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has
  been such speculative dollar selling in the market.
  

JAPAN ISOLATED, YEN RISES, WORLD FEELS CHEATED
  Japan is becoming dangerously isolated
  again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by
  Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,
  officials and businessmen from around the world said.
      As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,
  making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments
  grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
  there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.
      The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by
  both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.
      The document was prepared by a private committee formed by
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of
  Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction
  due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must "make a historical
  transformation in its traditional policies on economic
  management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further
  development for Japan without this transformation."
      Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have
  looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the
  Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term
  prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.
      The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese
  prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to
  raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to
  the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral
  semiconductor pact.
      British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to
  block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese
  placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid
  by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic
  telecommunications joint venture.
      On Friday, European currency dealers said European central
  banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might
  leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.
      Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group
  Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory
  views last November when he visited the European Community.
  "Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I
  found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe
  was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the
  results of the Maekawa report," he said.
      "We explained that the process of restructuring the economy
  away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between
  domestic and external demand...Would take time," Saito said.
      Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial
  Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said "I
  only know that your government, under the leadership of
  Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less
  outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa
  report which has attracted the most attention in Europe."
      And Europeans and Americans want quick action. "A far better
  answer than protectionism would be structural change within the
  Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And
  we hope to see changes occur in the near future," visiting
  Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.
      Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the
  fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of
  change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.
      Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business
  leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade
  problem.
      "We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the
  Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"
  said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.
      "The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it
  is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their
  labour," said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of
  Shearson Lehman Brothers.
      Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.
      Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as
  fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled
  the country asking about this issue.
      He said People mentioned many things in line with the
  spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and
  steel industries.
      A major misunderstanding is that the private report was
  government policy. Europeans are confused about this,
  underlined by von Moltke's reference to the "leadership" of the
  Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last
  September's government programme of new economic measures.
  "Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out
  that the government has put its signature to a programme
  designed to implement the report," the ambassador said.
  

H.K. DEALERS SAY NAKASONE G-6 COMMENT TOO LATE
  Remarks by Japan's Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to
  stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to
  influence currency trading, dealers said.
      After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen
  from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish
  of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering,
  they said.
      "I think (Nakasone's) desperate," said a U.S. Bank foreign
  exchange manager.
      Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament
  that Japan and other industrialized nations committed
  themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above
  150 yen.
      Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee
  that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
  West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar
  fell below 150 yen.
      "His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should
  have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150
  yen," said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust.
      Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and
  is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145
  yen.
      Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S.
  And Japan will continue to depress the dollar.
      The trade issue has now become a political issue since the
  Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over
  th3pYgks in cutting the country's 169.8 billion dlr trade
  deficit, they said.
  

INDONESIAN RUPIAH SLIPS AGAINST MARK AND YEN
  The Indonesian rupiah has held steady
  since its 31 pct devaluation against the dollar six months ago,
  but has slipped against the mark and to a lesser extent against
  the yen, according to central bank figures.
      In the past month, the rupiah has fallen five pct against
  the yen. Today's middle rate per 100 yen was 1,129.78 against
  1,075.20 at end-February and 1,058.6 at devaluation in
  September.
      Bank Indonesia's quoted rate for the dollar, the main
  currency for Indonesia's oil and gas exports, was 1,644.0
  today, the same rate fixed at the time of devaluation.
      The rate for the West German mark was 913.28 today, a sharp
  drop from September when it was 786.06.
      The British pound has risen to 2,657.93 against 2,429.83.
     The value of the rupiah is set daily against a basket of
  currencies by the central bank.
      The rise in the value of the mark and the yen has hit
  Indonesia by increasing its debt servicing levels. Its total
  disbursed foreign debt is estimated by the World Bank at 37
  billion dlrs.
      Japan is one of Indonesia's key trading partners, taking
  half its oil exports.
  

G-6 WANTS TO HOLD DLR ABOVE 150 YEN - NAKASONE
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said
  that Japan and other industrialized nations committed
  themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above
  150 yen.
      He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that
  the six nations have taken measures, including market
  intervention, to support the dollar above that level.
      Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee
  that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
  West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar
  fell below 150 yen.
      Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize
  exchange rates.
      Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of
  each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did
  not think the fundamentals themselves had changed
  substantially.
      But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is
  happening in major nations. He did not elaborate.
      Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has
  been such speculative dollar selling in the market.
  

MIYAZAWA EXPECTS DOLLAR REBOUND SOON - SPOKESMAN
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
  expects the dollar to rebound soon, a Ministry spokesman said.
      He quoted Miyazawa as telling Japanese reporters that major
  industrial nations are aggressively intervening in currency
  markets worldwide to prevent a dollar free-fall.
      The minister believes that market forces will push the
  dollar back up from its record low of 144.70 yen today,
  according to the spokesman.
      Miyazawa told the Japanese reporters the U.S. Unit fell
  because Japanese investors sold dollars to hedge currency risks
  before the close of the 1986/87 fiscal year on March 31.
  

SUMITA SAYS HE DOES NOT EXPECT FURTHER DOLLAR FALL
  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
  said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall
  further.
      He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that
  the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with
  other major nations to stabilize exchange rates.
      The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch
  on exchange rate movements since last week, he said.
      He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of
  underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen.
      Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to
  overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the
  U.S. over semiconductors.
      The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from
  expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic
  restructuring, he said.
  

DLR FALLS ON FEARS, MIYAZAWA SAYS
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
  that the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable
  to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has
  failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand.
      He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that
  it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not
  doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88
  budget.
      The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of
  Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax.
  

JAPAN SET TO RIDE OUT YEN RISE, OFFICIALS SAY
  The government is determined to ride out
  the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures
  because it expects the currency's appreciation to prove
  temporary, senior officials said.
      "The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and
  market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit," one senior
  Finance Ministry official said.
      He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to special
  factors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of
  the March 31 end to their fiscal year.
      That selling largely came to an end this morning after
  about one hour of trading here, the senior official said. "They
  (the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock
  (0100 GMT)," he said.
      After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning,
  the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20.
  Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise
  the dollar above 150 yen.
      Several officials said they did not see any fundamental
  reason for the dollar's recent sharp fall.
      One official even called the market's recent actions
  irrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on
  Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against
  the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He
  said.
      As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to
  alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last
  month's meeting of major nations in Paris.
      "We don't see any substantial reason to change our policy
  stance," one senior official said.
  

BANK OF JAPAN MULLS OTHER OPTIONS TO STOP YEN RISE
  Today's liberalised financial markets are
  making it extremely difficult for Japan's monetary authorities
  to prevent the yen's rise against the dollar, but they have
  several options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japan
  sources said.
      A senior central bank official said that such methods as
  controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap
  agreements with other central banks, which have not been
  invoked since 1978, are all being considered.
      "But the time may not be ripe," he said.
      "In this era of financial liberalisation, it's almost
  impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,"
  said another senior bank official.
      But the first official said: "From a technical viewpoint,
  the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately
  after other central banks involved agreed to do so."
      A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between two
  nations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the
  other's currency in case of need.
      "If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announce
  the decision jointly," said the first official.
      The sources said they believed the limit of currency market
  intervention may be being reached after they saw recent
  concerted market action by central banks of major industrial
  nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the
  battered dollar.
      But intervention is at least an option, they said. Further
  easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an
  official discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, they
  said.
      Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled
  out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation.
      One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of
  the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the
  U.S. And other central banks, if these banks continue
  intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run
  out of their yen cash positions.
      "But we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet,"
  he said.
      The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with
  the U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200
  billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks,
  according to the sources.
      Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two
  billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the
  dollar in New York last week.
      The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other
  currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find
  it necessary, but added they are not actually talking with each
  other towards that end.
  

U.S. MAY DROP TARIFFS IF JAPAN OPENS - YEUTTER
  The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs on
  Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an
  agreemement opening its markets to American goods, U.S. Trade
  Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview.
      "But there has to be a clear indication that they are
  willing to act," he said.
      Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by
  the U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are
  problems "they have brought on themselves."
      The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.
      "Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic
  turmoil in Japan," he said. "My only response is that we have
  gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the
  opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurred
  for only a few weeks or months in Japan."
      The tarriffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, will
  affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tiny
  fraction of Japan's total exports to the U.S.
      Even so, Reagan's decision "doesn't give us any joy. We
  don't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to,"
  Yeutter said.
      Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in
  Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
  will include "some difficult items on the agenda."
      Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part
  semiconductor agreement, Yeutter said.
      Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has
  failed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and has
  failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries,
  undercutting U.S. Products, he said.

CHIRAC SAYS FRANCE RESOLVED TO SUPPORT CURRENCY PACT
  French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
  said that on financial issues, the United States and France had
  "very close" views, and he said Treasury Secretary James Baker
  was determined to support the February 22 Paris agreement on
  stabilizing foreign exchange parities.
      "I was very reassured by the determination of Mr. Baker to
  support this agreement," he said.
      He described the dollar's sharp fall against the yen at the
  start of the week as a "passing incident" and added, "Everyone is
  resolved to support the Paris accord."
      Questioned about his plan to help the world's poorest
  countries, Chirac said he did not envisage any large-scale debt
  write-offs.
      "I don't think we can talk of write-offs - even the poorest
  countries have not asked for that," he said.
      Chirac said he wanted commercial banks to give third world
  countries better terms in rescheduling their debts, and for the
  International Monetary Fund to soften its conditions.
      "One cannot pity the banks - they bear a lot of
  responsibility due to the encouragement they gave to these
  countries to take on debts. Now the banks are complaining but I
  do not weep for them."
  

BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES JUST AFTER TOKYO OPENING
  The Bank of Japan intervened just after
  the Tokyo market opened, buying dollars at around 147.65 yen,
  dealers said.
      They were unsure of the amount of the central bank's
  purchasing, but it seemed to prevent the dollar from weakening
  against the yen amid bearish sentiment for the U.S. Currency,
  they said.
      The dollar opened at 147.65 yen against 147.20/30 in New
  York and 146.90 at the close here yesterday.
  

JAPAN CENTRAL BANK INTERVENES IN TOKYO AFTERNOON
  The Bank of Japan intervened in early
  afternoon Tokyo trading to support the dollar against active
  selling by institutional investors and speculative selling by
  overseas operators, dealers said.
      The central bank had also bought dollars against the yen in
  morning trade.
      The dollar traded around 145.20/30 yen when trading began
  in the afternoon here and weakened only slightly, the dealers
  said.
  

CURRENCY FUTURES TO KEY OFF G-5, G-7 MEETINGS
  News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7
  finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key
  to the direction of currency futures at the International
  Monetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyond
  the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financial
  analysts said.
      "If they (the finance ministers) give the market something
  really new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond
  the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the
  dollar," said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills.
      On the other hand, "anything neutral would tend to be
  bearish for the dollar," Mills said.
      Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the
  Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the
  dollar, nor will central bank intervention.
      "A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies
  and sell the dollar," said one trader for a large retail firm
  on the floor of the IMM.
      "If there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking
  to sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level," he
  said.
      Technically, most currency futures are poised for another
  rise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.
      Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high
  on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while June
  sterling set a new contract high on Monday.
      "Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you
  don't need much to get things rolling," Sloane said.
      In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloane
  recently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range
  between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle
  on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside.
      A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a
  breakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby
  Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the
  0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday.
      Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials
  between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed
  dramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds
  only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes.
      What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an
  increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the
  Canadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors.
      Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near
  the top of their long-term rally.
      "Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to
  calm people," said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.
      The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European
  currencies will trade, Horner said.
      But sterling futures may still make another run for new
  highs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the
  positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections
  and possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June
  British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday.
      Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of
  the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings.
      The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar
  between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152
  yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar's
  range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June
  contract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday.
      If such a range does emerge from the meetings, "we will
  have one more rally in the yen," Horner said.
  

NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN
  The highly visible drama involving the
  yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact
  that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major
  European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
  distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.
      The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
  by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the
  currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
  fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
  trade tensions and imbalances.
      Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
  already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-
  European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.
      In many ways, not least in terms of rare international
  cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between
  the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down
  the value of the dollar was a historic one.
      But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
  currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
  the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
  necessarily central significance, the officials said.
      The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took
  place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement
  simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in
  Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.
      "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
  and that was well before Plaza," he said.
      On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
  263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was
  242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and
  periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the
  dollar trend has been down, down, down.
      Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross
  rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The
  European currencies are moving back up against the yen.
      The close relationship between exchange rates and trade
  flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
  undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
  changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC
  both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
  This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
      Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of
  of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.
      Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
  pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
  and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
      "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a
  tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit
  sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
  to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is
  laying the golden egg," said de Hora.
      The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year
  in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
  start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.
      The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than
  U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
  imbalance, and which will cause problems.
      "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is
  reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But
  therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive
  edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International
  Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want
  my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our
  trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
  and this year we may have to do so again," he said.
  

U.S. COMMERCE DEPT'S ORTNER SAYS YEN IS 10 OR 15 PCT UNDERVALUED

  U.S. COMMERCE DEPT'S ORTNER SAYS YEN IS 10 OR 15 PCT UNDERVALUED
  

U.S. COMMERCE'S ORTNER SAYS YEN UNDERVALUED
  Commerce Dept. undersecretary of
  economic affairs Robert Ortner said that he believed the dollar
  at  current levels was fairly priced against most European
  currencies.
      In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import
  Bank, Ortner, the bank's senior economist also said he believed
  that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct.
      "I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point
  against the yen," he said.
      On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that "the yen
  is still a little bit undervalued," and "could go up another 10
  or 15 pct."
      In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally,
  said he thought that the dollar against most European
  currencies was "fairly priced."
      Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate
  values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate
  differentiations.
      Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade
  deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the
  Plaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the
  first 15 pct decline had little impact.
      He said there were indications now that the trade deficit
  was beginning to level off.
      Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that it
  would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough
  foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts.  He said
  the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined
  in Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt initiative.
  

U.S. TREASURY SAYS NO COMMENT ON YEN VALUE
  A Treasury Department spokesman
  refused comment on statements by Robert Ortner, undersecretary
  of economic affairs for the Commerce Department, that the
  Japanese yen was undervalued.
      Ortner, senior economist at the Commerce Department, told
  an Export-Import Bank conference "the yen is still a little bit
  undervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct."
      Asked for reaction, a Treasury spokesman said officials
  were aware of Ortner's comments but had no intention of making
  any comment on them.
      Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said
  he thought the U.S. dollar was "fairly priced"
  against most European currencies and added "I do not regard the
  dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said.
      But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner
  said, because it is undervalued against the dollar.
      The United States and major trade allies West Germany,
  France, Britain, Japan and Canada met recently in Paris to
  discuss maintaining stability in international currency values.

  the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
  necessarily central significance, the officials said.
      The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took
  place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement
  simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in
  Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.
      "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
  and that was well before Plaza," he said.
      On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
  263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was
  242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and
  periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the
  dollar trend has been down, down, down.
      Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross
  rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The
  European currencies are moving back up against the yen.
      The close relationship between exchange rates and trade
  flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
  undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
  changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC
  both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
  This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
      Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of
  of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.
      Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
  pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
  and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
      "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a
  tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit
  sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
  to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is
  laying the golden egg," said de Hora.
      The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year
  in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
  start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.
      The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than
  U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
  imbalance, and which will cause problems.
      "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is
  reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But
  therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive
  edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International
  Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want
  my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our
  trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
  and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

U.S. INTERVENED TO BUY 50 MLN DLRS AGAINST YEN ON JANUARY 28, FED SAYS

  U.S. INTERVENED TO BUY 50 MLN DLRS AGAINST YEN ON JANUARY 28, FED SAYS
  

BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES SOON AFTER TOKYO OPENING
  The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of
  dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen, dealers
  said.
      The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house
  sold dollars, putting pressure on the U.S. Currency, they said.
      The dollar was also supported by a major electrical
  consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at
  around 145.25 yen, they added.
      The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New
  York and 145.25 at the close here yesterday.
  

POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
  said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
  of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
  economic growth.
      In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
  here, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
  for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
  correct the trade deficit."
      He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
  depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
  route.
      Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
  U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
  accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
  above-target money supply growth.
      He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
  five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
  the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
  political constraints getting such measures through the upper
  house of the West German parliament.
      But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
  accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
      Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
  one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
  erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
  demand at home.
      "A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
  obstacle to further growth," he said.
      Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
  growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
  because external factors, including low oil prices and
  favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
      But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
  over monetary policy.
      The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
  reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
  was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
      "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
  on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
  money supply. But we must be very careful," he said.
      He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
  trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
  the United States.
      Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
  officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
  importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
  rates had been underestimated.
      All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
  right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
  said.
      "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
  part of our American colleagues," he said.
      But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
  the dollar's value could overshoot.
  

J.P. MORGAN&lt;JPM> SAYS DLR MAY PREVENT FED EASING
  The relatively high level of real U.S.
  interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
  declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
  unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
  volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
      He said in response to a reporter's question after the
  bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
  further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
  as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."
      On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
  dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
      He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
  was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
  rates."
      Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
  economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
  year.
      He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
  and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5
  to four pct rate in 1987.
  

BANK OF JAPAN BUYS DOLLARS IN TOKYO, DEALERS SAY
  The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount
  of dollars at around 145.10 yen just after the market here
  opened, dealers said.
      Just before the opening, the dollar dropped swiftly as
  speculators concluded the Group of Seven (G-7) comminuique
  issued in Washington contained nothing basically new, they
  said. It fell about a half yen, to around 145.
      The G-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current
  levels reflect economic fundamentals.
      One dealer said the Bank of Japan probably intervened in
  Australia before the opening here, but could not confirm this.
  

EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
      "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
  AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  near term, the traders said.
      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
      Traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
  "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
      Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
      "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
  in the next three months.
      A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
  the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
  should not have produced disappointment.
      "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
  policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
  timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told
  Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time."
      Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
  Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
  currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent
  remedy?" he asked.
      Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
  the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
  in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
      A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
  now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
  Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
  lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
      Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
  pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
  while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
  support the Paris accord.

U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS
  The United States, which has long
  sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
  satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and
  allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
  to stabilize currencies.
      Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced
  yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.
      But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
  powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
  the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.
      And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far
  East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that
  currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the
  countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point
  despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.
      Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the
  movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading
  ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.
      "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
  discussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.
      The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
  announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of
  Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's
  meetings of leading industrial nations.
      In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action
  "extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris
  Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
  broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
      The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West
  Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore
  repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
  foster exchange rate stability.
      The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
  bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
  dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
  intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
  years. Monetary sources also said they understood that
  Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely
  successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.
      They also said there was a growing feeling among the
  finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
  medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
  differences in past meetings.
      West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
  the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of
  yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
  countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
      Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that
  major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
  between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's
  trade deficit have already taken place.
      No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut
  the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
  reafffirmation of Paris.
      European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are
  essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that
  reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
      A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this
  week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further
  sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose
  substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
  undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.
      Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
  politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.
      Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany
  welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
  currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.
      Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak
  dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the
  Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.
      The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
  their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian
  Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.
      Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit
  to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
      The United States and France, backed by the International
  Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a
  limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
  inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
  account balances.
      Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
  consultations between the countries on whether corrective
  action should be required.
      But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
  has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it
  implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
      The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully
  sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
  currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.
      The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
  of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
  relatively free currency markets of recent years.
  

STOLTENBERG NOT SURPRISED BY DOLLAR REACTION
  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg said he was not surprised by the overnight decline
  of the dollar in foreign exchange markets.
      Speaking briefly with reporters before entering a meeting
  of the International Monetary Fund he said, "These minor
  movements don't really affect us."
      The dollar declined in the initial reaction to a statement
  by the Group of Seven industrial countries reaffirming their
  Paris agreement in February to maintain their currencies around
  current levels.
  

DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT
  The dollar drifted down to end one
  pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
  lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
  comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
      Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
  from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
  although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
  attempts to push it lower through the day.
      The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
  yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
      Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
  based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
  comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
  adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
  Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
      Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7
  as "soft as wax."
      Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
  a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no
  current reason to change monetary course at present.
      Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
  yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
  Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
  said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
  may be under consideration.
      German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
  pct after 3.80 yesterday.
      Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
  via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
  week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
  at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
      But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
  said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
  theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."
      Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
  comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
  3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
  1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
      Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
  last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
  per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
  1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
      EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last
  night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing
  however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.
  

FED BUYING DOLLARS FOR YEN IN OPEN MARKET, NEW YORK DEALERS SAY

  FED BUYING DOLLARS FOR YEN IN OPEN MARKET, NEW YORK DEALERS SAY
  

FED SEEN BUYING DOLLARS FOR YEN IN OPEN MARKET
  The Federal Reserve was detected buying
  dollars for yen in the open market as the dollar fell to a
  40-year low of 144.60 yen in nervous late morning trading,
  currency dealers said.
       They said the size of the intervention was relatively
  modest so far but it was a clear indication that the U.S.
  remained committed to the late February Paris currency
  stabilization accord, which was reaffirmed in Washington last
  night.
      A Fed spokeswoman had no comment on the dealer reports.
      The dollar hovered around 144.70 just before midday.
  

ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE
  Economists said that they doubt the
  Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite
  higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week
  statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.
      Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged
  393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln
  dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were
  1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.
      "One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it
  probably isn't," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.
      Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy
  modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the
  two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging
  around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.
      However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest
  two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand
  often pushes up borrrowings.
      "Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it
  looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions
  late in the statement period and didn't quite make it," said
  Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
      A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that
  the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or
  more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.
      Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in
  its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer
  reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.
      The Fed took no market reserve management action last
  Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added
  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of
  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves
  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.
      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the
  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on
  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's
  overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.
      "It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at
  this time," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.
      Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi
  said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest
  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak
  economies in the United States and abroad and add to the
  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.
      "Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest
  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar
  tumbled," said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.
      He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new
  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's
  Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed
  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.
      In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in
  Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that
  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade
  imbalance between the United States and Japan.
      The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for
  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average
  Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where
  the rate has been since early November.
      "I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter
  policy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said Sullivan of
  Dean Witter.
      If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just
  nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from
  six to 6.10 pct previously.

DOLLAR OPENS AT TOKYO RECORD LOW OF 143.75 YEN
  The dollar opened at a record Tokyo low
  of 143.75 yen despite aggressive Bank of Japan intervention,
  dealers said.
      The previous record low was 144.70 yen set on March 30. The
  opening compares with 143.90/144.00 yen at the close in New
  York.
      The central bank bought dollars through Tokyo brokers just
  before and after the market opening, the dealers said.
      The intervention took place when the dollar fell to 143.20
  yen, one dealer said.
      The dollar opened at 1.8155/60 marks against 1.8187/97 in
  New York.
      The dollar fell as low as 142.90 yen despite central bank
  intervention at 143.00 yen, dealers said.
      Selling pressure was strong from securities houses and
  institutional investors in hectic and nervous trading on
  underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar, they said.
      Most dealers were surpised by the dollar's sharp fall
  against the yen in New York, although many had expected such a
  drop to happen eventually.
      Institutional investors are expected to sell the dollar
  aggressively if it rises to around 143.50 yen, dealers said.
      The U.S. Currency steadied well above 143.00 yen after Bank
  of Japan intervention and scattered short-covering, they said.
      The dollar opened at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs against
  1.5085/00 at the New York close.
      Sterling started at 1.6190/00 dlrs against 1.6195/05.

G-7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION
  Top officials of leading industrial
  nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have
  ignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they
  believe they strengthened in talks last week.
      Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the
  markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely
  disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the
  policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,
  Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
      Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to
  reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a
  statement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
  underscored that by saying: "I don't believe at all that the
  Americans want a weaker dollar."
      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the
  dollar's latest rapid descent "involves the risk -- now already
  a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,
  leading to a renewed rise in interest rates."
      But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared
  the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they
  could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies
  settled into a stable pattern as a result.
      Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's
  semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher
  U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid
  descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.
      Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told
  television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving
  the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.
      "It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would
  adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would
  drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not
  (into) recession, into slower growth," he said.
      Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the
  dollar, Balladur said: "When a currency is maintained
  artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is
  not healthy."
      And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to
  recession, he said.
      Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of
  life, Balladur said, "there may be adjustments of course in one
  or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system."
      But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he
  might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.
      U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it
  understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.
      "The United States and the six major industrial countries
  are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these
  agreements," Baker told the meetings.
      Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which
  wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further
  decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to
  stabilizing currencies at current levels.
      Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February
  22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed
  to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight
  protectionism.
      West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate
  domestic demand and lead a global upturn.
      Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's
  promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.
      The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major
  action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable
  currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at
  the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.
      The Paris accord said, "currencies (are) within ranges
  broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given
  the policy commitments summarized in this statement."
      Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially
  against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent
  with the agreement. "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the
  view that around current levels their currencies are within
  ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals," last week's
  statement read.
      Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were
  focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.
  Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan
  rather than prospective policy changes. European monetary
  sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant
  business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.

JAPAN HAS NO PLANS FOR NEW MEASURES TO AID DLR
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
  Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support
  the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.
      He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday
  intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.
      Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the
  countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.
      With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,
  0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan
  might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as
  curbing capital outflows.
      Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in
  U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the
  growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are
  not that good, he said.
      He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is
  expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways
  to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.
      Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring
  by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said it
  was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect.
  

U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND
  The dollar's recent signs of stability
  have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
  but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
  after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
      "The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
  dollar has bottomed out," said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
      Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
  against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
  orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
  world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
      On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
  but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
  topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
      Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
  enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
      The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
  from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
  improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
      Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
  further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
  towards 150 yen.
      "There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
  out for the medium term," added Tom Campbell of First National
  Bank of Chicago.
      Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
  expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
  be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
  larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
      The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
  speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
  bank intervention to support the dollar.
      The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
  the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
  dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
  since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
      Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
  volume as "impressive".
      James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
  however: "the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
  data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
  140 yen."
      Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
  warned, "I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."
      Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
  said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
  the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
      Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
  to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
  which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
  commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
      President Reagan said today, "economic policy decisions
  made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
  Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
  ignored or forgotten."
      "The commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the
  40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
      Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
  analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
  brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
      Marine Midland's O'Neill said, "pressure will build up on
  Germany to take stimulative action like Japan."
      Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
  could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
  under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
  not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
  surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
  banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
  positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
  portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
  positions, Japanese bank dealers said.
  

GREENSPAN SAYS THERE IS EVIDENCE DOLLAR HAS BOTTOMED OUT

  GREENSPAN SAYS THERE IS EVIDENCE DOLLAR HAS BOTTOMED OUT
  

GREENSPAN SEES EVIDENCE DOLLAR FALL OVER
  Newly-nominated Federal Reserve Board
  chairman Alan Greenspan said there was evidence the dollar
  finally had bottomed out.
      In a White House briefing Greenspan was asked by reporters
  if he thought the dollar had bottomed out.
      "There certainly is evidence in that direction," he replied.
  

VOLCKER DEPARTURE REVIVES DLR, INFLATION FEARS
  Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a
  third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of
  Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about
  the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem
  rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
      Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
  fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
  the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
  political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
  campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
      "The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with
  inflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko
  Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for
  monetary and financial policy at the Fed.
      "A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's
  departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will
  remain nervous," added Stephen Slifer, money market economist
  at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
      This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a
  tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank
  intervention in the open currency market.

FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY
  New U.S. Banking data suggest the
  Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
  and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
  said.
      But they also said that if money supply growth remains
  weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
  suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
  credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
  policy.
      A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
  forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
  8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
  decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
  to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
      Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
  the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
  fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
  economists said.
      "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said Bill Sullivan
  of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
      While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
  economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
  the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
  in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
  as better gauges of economic growth.
      Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
  measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
      If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
  concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
  could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
      "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
  market position? No," Sullivan said. "But does this mean the end
  of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."
      Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
  of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
  were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
  targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
      But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
  net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
  borrowings target would probably have been reached.
      A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
  auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
  while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
  helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
      "If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
  easing at some point," he said.
      Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
  attention to weak money supply growth. "It has been a number of
  years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
  economy," one said. "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
  falling apart and the Fed should ease."
      Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
  prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
  policy.
      They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
  for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
  higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
  off econmomic growth.
      But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
  April. "The Fed has to determine if this represents a
  fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
  them more room to ease," he said.
  

JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS
  Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
  value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And
  other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
  advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency
  (EPA) said.
      The advisory body said in its report that the yen would
  soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
  basis were delayed.
      An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to
  slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to
  restructure their economies.
      The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
  Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
  product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change
  would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
  during the seven-year period to 1993.
      If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's
  current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This
  scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.
      It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
  and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.

BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS
  News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
  dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
      News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
  secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
  Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
  that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
      The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
  pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
      The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
  in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
  markets.
      Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
  accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
  spokesman in Bonn said.
      The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
  1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
      The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
  reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
  rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
  West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
      Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
  coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
  the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
  their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
  deficit.
      West German government sources said rising West German
  money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
  pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
  rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
  since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
  raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
      German yields have also risen over this period, but less
  markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
  short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
  repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
  money market.
      The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
  compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
  inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
  Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
  growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
  bank economists said.
      This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
  pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
  since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
  more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
      In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
  the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
  morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
  anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
      "They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
  under American fire," said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
  Swiss Bank Corp here.
      "It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
  significant retreat from its position," added Giles Keating,
  economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
      The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
  the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
  on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
  economists said.
      Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
  does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
  rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
      The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
  that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
  Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
      Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
  comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
  accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
  assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
      The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
  Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
  Denmark and Belgium.
  

FED'S JOHNSON WARNS AGAINST LOWER DOLLAR
  Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman
  Manuel Johnson cautioned against seeking "quick-fix solutions" to
  persistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.
      In particular, he told an American Stock Exchange
  conference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would
  exacerbate financial market conditions.
      "Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below
  current levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions
  and lead to further potential for financial problems."
      Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S.
  businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.
      He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persisting
  despite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the
  past two years.
      But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon
  begin showing improvement.
      "The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructive
  expansion without inflationary instability," he said.

  unit. It is located 30 kms east of the Adelaide River at Mt.
  Bundey, WMC said in a statement
      It said the open-pit mine, with a conventional leach
  treatment plant, is expected to produce about 50,000 ounces of
  gold in its first year of production from mid-1988. Annual ore
  capacity will be about 750,000 tonnes.

U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS
  Commodities from gold to grains to
  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
  inflation and economic instability.
      Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
  York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
  troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
      A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
  Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
  Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
      The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
      Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
  as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
  direction of the currency markets.
      "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "If
  they do, it's not evident."
      "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
  take values to where they should be.
      "One way or another, we will force our major trading
  partners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correct
  the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
      "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
  time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
  happening," he said.
      The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
      At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
  McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
  Dominick and Dominick.
      The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
  posted broad gains.
      Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
  export demand.
      After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
  higher.
      Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
  hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
  this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
  work to market animals.
  

ST.GOBAIN UNIT ISSUES ECU BOND WITH GOLD WARRANTS
  St.Gobain Netherlands, guaranteed by Cie
  de St.Gobain, is issuing a 75 mln ECU bond with gold warrants
  attached, due May 6, 1992 carrying a 4-1/2 pct coupon and
  priced at par, lead manager Salomon Brothers International Ltd
  said.
      Fees comprise 1-1/4 pct selling concession with 5/8 pct for
  management and underwriting combined. Listing is in Luxembourg.
      Each 1,000 ECU bond carries one gold warrant exercisable
  from May 6, 1987 until May 6, 1990 entitling the holder to
  purchase one ounce at an exercise price of 490 dlrs.
  

LONDON GOLD MORNING FIX HIGHEST SINCE OCTOBER
  Gold bullion continued to move higher
  supported by good general buying and was fixed this morning at
  436.50 dlrs, 268.368 stg, an ounce, up from Friday's close of
  432.00/50, dealers said.
      The setting was the highest since October 8 as gold built
  on Friday's gains, which had been based on the weakness of the
  dollar and fears of a trade war between the United States and
  Japan.
      It opened slightly firmer at 433.50/434.00 and moved up
  steadily during the morning supported by commission house and
  trade buying, dealers said.
      Dealers said there was resistance around 440.00 but with
  sentiment still firm some traders believe the rally may even
  take gold as high as 500 dlrs.
      Platinum was fixed this morning at 583.50 dlrs an ounce, up
  from Friday's close of 578.50/580.50, and also the highest
  setting since October.
  

SIX KILLED IN SOUTH AFRICAN MINE
  Six workers were killed and four
  injured in an undeground rock fall at South Africa's second
  largest gold mine today, the mine owners said.
      It was the third major mine accident in the country in less
  than a week.
      Thirty four workers died in methane gas explosion at a coal
  mine last Thursday.
  

MORE BRITISH GOLD ARTICLES HALLMARKED
  The number of British gold articles
  hallmarked during the first quarter of this year rose by more
  than 11 pct on the corresponding period last year, figures
  released by the Assay Offices of Great Britain show.
      More than 2.5 mln British items were hallmarked during the
  quarter, up 11.1 pct on the same year ago period. The four
  Assay Offices also marked 832,222 foreign gold articles, up 2.5
  pct on last year.
      In weight terms the 7.19 mln grams of British gold assayed
  was a 15.3 pct increase, while the 2.95 mln grams of foreign
  gold represented a rise of 3.1 pct.
      British silver goods assayed totalled 698,132, an increase
  of 6.2 pct but only 78,457 foreign items were marked, a fall of
  11.1 pct.
      A total of 10,968 kilos of silver were assayed, an 11.1 pct
  rise.
      The number of platinum items marked fell 12.5 pct to 1,785,
  while in weight terms the total slipped 8.1 pct to 9,849 grams.
      A spokesman for the Assay Offices of Great Britain said he
  was particularly encouraged to see the percentage increase for
  British manufactured goods.
  

GIANT BAY &lt;GBYLF> IN IDAHO GOLD VENTURE
  Giant Bay Resources
  Ltd said it signed an agreement in principle with Hecla Mining
  Co for an operating joint venture on Hecla's Stibnite, Idaho,
  gold deposit.
      Giant Bay said if its bioleaching technology is used for
  ore processing, it will have the right to acquire a working
  interest in the property. It said it may spend as much as three
  mln U.S. dlrs, excluding capital costs to bring the mine into
  production. It said drilling has indicated substantial sulphide
  reserves with a gold grade of about 0.1 ounce a ton, and early
  tests show the gold ore responds to bioleaching.
  

HOMESTAKE &lt;HM> MULLS BUYING ORE RESERVES
  Homestake Mining Co is considering
  acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's
  exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters
  in an interview.
      "We are looking at more options to acquire more reserves
  rather than just exploration," Conger said adding, "the move to
  consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's
  acquisitions policy."
      Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120
  mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,
  Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which
  have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an
  acquisition, he said.
      Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be
  about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said
  exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than
  last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas
  exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6
  pct.
      Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about
  the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.
      However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin
  reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400
  ounces due to start-up production problems.
      He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400
  U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.
       IN 1986, company earnings were based an average market
  price for gold of 368 dlrs an ounce.
      Conger said a three pct change in gold prices represents a
  12 cts a share impact on earnings but he declined to give a
  specific forecast for 1987's first quarter, due to be released
  in 10 days, or for full year 1987 results.

RENISON GC AND CITY RESOURCES SET PNG GOLD VENTURE
  Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd
  &lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) and explorer &lt;City Resources Ltd> have agreed in
  principle on a joint venture to re-examine the Bulolo alluvial
  gold field in Papua New Guinea, City Resources said.
      City Resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct of
  RGC's Prospecting Authority 585, which covers all the field, by
  spending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement.
      It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the
  past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in
  tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a
  total of 2.1 mln ounces.
      City Resources also said previous dredging was only carried
  out to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are
  reported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the
  Bulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.
      In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolo
  was 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of
  gravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator.
      The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the first
  successful gold mining operation of &lt;Placer Development Ltd>
  after it was floated in Canada in 1926. It operated the field
  until dredging ceased in 1967.
  

NORTHGATE QUEBEC GOLD WORKERS END STRIKE
  Northgate Exploration Ltd said
  hourly-paid workers at its two Chibougamau, Quebec mines voted
  on the weekend to accept a new three-year contract offer and
  returned to work today after a one-month strike.
      It said the workers, represented by United Steelworkers of
  America, would receive a 1.21 dlr an hour pay raise over the
  life of the new contract and improved benefits.
      Northgate, which produced 23,400 ounces of gold in first
  quarter, said that while the strike slowed production, "We are
  still looking forward to a very satisfactory performance."
      The Chibougamau mines produced 81,500 ounces of gold last
  year.

LITTLE REACTION TO COMEX PRICE LIMIT REMOVAL
  The elimination of price limits on
  precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in
  New York appears to be having little effect on the market,
  analysts said.
      "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William
  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
  "The market has not approached the old price limits and trading
  is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he added.
      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on
  market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker
  in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.
      On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two
  contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver
  futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.
      During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and
  down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to
  rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts
  said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much
  confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.
      The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms
  a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades
  in a timely manner.
      Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the
  nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.
      O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX
  metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts
  could move any distance.
      "This is amore realistic approach because the metals market
  is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"
  O'Neill said.
      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
  buying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.
  

LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS
  The elimination of limits on daily price
  fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the
  Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect
  on the market, analysts said.
      "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William
  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
      "The market has not approached the old price limits and
  trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he said.
      On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two
  contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper
  and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,
  which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver
  futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting
  of all daily limits, effective today.
      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per
  ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the
  nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.
      Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back
  months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby
  contracts amid quiet trading today.
      During the last week of April, silver futures often traded
  at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the
  dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or
  unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.
      As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many
  unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.
      The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs
  for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.
      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic

U.S. GOLD, SILVER, PLATINUM SOAR ON VOLCKER REJECTION OF 3RD TERM

  U.S. GOLD, SILVER, PLATINUM SOAR ON VOLCKER REJECTION OF 3RD TERM
  

SKYLINE &lt;SKX.V> EXPECTS TO BEGIN MINE IN JULY
  Skyline Explorations Ltd said expects
  construction can begin next month on a gold mine at Johnny
  Mountain Camp, located 600 miles north of Vancouver.
      The company said a contract has been let for a 200 to 400
  tons per day mill and the company is receiving cooperation from
  provincial and federal agencies on its stage one report,
  "approval in principal," which is required before actual
  construction can begin.
      Skyline said it is optimistic the approval in principal
  will be received in late June, by which time it expects to have
  confirmed threshold tonnage and grade targets so construction
  can begin in July.
     
      Skyline said the 1987 exploration drift on 16 vien east at
  Johnny Mountain has advanced 320 feet. The vein is continuous,
  averaging four feet thick plus an altered mineralized hanging
  wall.
      It said periodic face samples indicate an average grade of
  1.05 ounces per ton of ore ranging from a low of 0.78 ounce per
  ton to a high of 55.8 ounces per ton.
  

TOTAL ERICKSON &lt;TLE.T> BUYS MINING PROPERTY

U.S. MINERALS &lt;USMX.O> COMMISSIONS NEW GOLD MINE
  U.S. Minerals Exploration Co said it and
  Pegasus Gold Inc &lt;PGUL.O> of Spokane, Wash, officially
  commissioned a new gold, zinc and lead producing mine.
      U.S. Minerals said the new Montana Tunnels Mine near
  Helena, Mont, is expected to reach full production in August
  1987. U.S. Minerals said the mine is designed to operate at an
  average of 12,500 tons or ore per day and is projected to
  produce 95,000 ounces of gold in 1988, plus significant
  quantities of silver, lead and zinc.
      U.S. Minerals said it has a 50 pct net profit royalty
  interest in the mine after payback of development costs.
  

GUNNAR GOLD (GGG.TO) IN VENTURE AGREEMENT

      Gunnar said it and Mill City can earn a 50 pct interest in
  Tyranex's option to buy the Tyranite gold mine by spending up
  to five mln dlrs on exploration, development, and feasibility
  studies by 1990.
      It said the companies may form a joint venture partnership

SPHINX MINING &lt;SPNXF.O> FINDS GOLD
  Sphinx Mining Inc said leased
  mining claims in Alaska could produce revenues between 322 mln
  dlrs and 966 mln dlrs from gold reserves.
      The range of the value of the reserves is attributed to the
  wide range of grade estimates of the ore, the company said.
      A 1984 feasibility study put the grade at 0.008 ounces per
  cubic yard, while subsequent exploration work proved that areas
  of higher-grade gravel of up to 0.027 ounces/yard do exist,
  Sphinx said.
      The claims are located 80 miles northwest of Fairbanks.
  

SWEDEN'S BOLIDEN TO OPEN SAUDI ARABIAN GOLD MINE
  Mining group Boliden AB said it had
  agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral
  Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to
  exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.
      Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish
  group would  be responsible for the technical side of the
  operation and would have no control over the product itself.
      He said one option under discussion for refining the gold
  ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in
  northern Sweden.
      Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it
  was strategically important since it increased Boliden's
  presence in Saudi Arabia.
      "Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar
  already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the
  future," he said.
      The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab
  in the west of the country and should open in the first half of
  1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold
  smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.
      Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi
  Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to
  open in modern times.
      "This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining
  technology and knowhow," said the group's chief executive, Kjell
  Nilsson.
  

ARIZONA SILVER &lt;ASC> REPORTS ON BURRO CREEK
  Arizona Silver Corp
  said diamond drilling on its Burro Creek Mine Property, located
  65 miles southeast of Kingman, Ariz., has begun.
      The company said a report indicated that the Burro Creek
  project area which covers 800 acres, could have potential
  reserves of three to four mln tons of gold and silver
  mineralization.
      Drill sites have been established and a diamond drilling
  program consisting of an initial 5,000 feet of drilling began
  October 13, the company said.
  

SIX KILLED IN SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD MINE ACCIDENT
  Six black miners have been killed
  and two injured in a rock fall three km underground at a South
  African gold mine, the owners said on Sunday.
      &lt;Rand Mines Properties Ltd>, one of South Africa's big six
  mining companies, said in a statement that the accident
  occurred on Saturday morning at the &lt;East Rand Proprietary
  Mines Ltd> mine at Boksburg, 25 km east of Johannesburg.
      A company spokesman could not elaborate on the short

CANAMAX, PACIFIC TRANS-OCEAN APPROVE PRODUCTION
  &lt;Canamax Resources Inc> and &lt;Pacific
  Trans-Ocean Resources Ltd> said they conditionally approved
  starting production at their jointly owned Ketza River gold
  deposit in the Yukon after a study recommended the move.
      They said production was conditional on approval of a water
  license and arrangement of appropriate financing. They
  estimated development costs for the mine and mill would total
  21.1 mln dlrs, including three mln dlrs of working capital.
      The feasibility study anticipated gold production of 49,600
  ounces a year at a cost of 129 Canadian dlrs a short ton, they
  said.
      Canamax and Pacific Trans-Ocean said the project would
  yield a 40 pct after-tax real rate of return at a gold price of
  400 U.S. dlrs an ounce.
      They said they would mine 460,000 tonnes of proven and
  probable mineable reserves of oxide ore grading 0.45 ounce gold
  ton at a yearly rate of 112,000 tonnes for a mine life of 4.25
  years.
      Possible reserves of 75,000 tonnes grading 0.38 ounce gold
  ton at the break zone would extend mine life by a year, with
  considerable potential for development of further oxide ore
  reserves at the deposit, they said.
  

GOLD PRODUCTION TO START AT KETZA RIVER
  Canamax Resources Inc and Pacific
  Trans-Ocean Resources Ltd said they conditionally approved
  starting production at their jointly owned Ketza River gold
  deposit in the Yukon after a study recommended the move.
      They said production was conditional on approval of a water
  license and arrangement of appropriate financing. They
  estimated development costs for the mine and mill would total
  21.1 mln dlrs, including three mln dlrs of working capital.
      The feasibility study anticipated gold production of 49,600
  ounces a year at a cost of 129 Canadian dlrs a short ton, they
  said.
      Canamax and Pacific Trans-Ocean said the project would
  yield a 40 pct after-tax real rate of return at a gold price of
  400 U.S. dlrs an ounce.
      They said they would mine 460,000 tonnes of proven and
  probable mineable reserves of oxide ore grading 0.45 ounce gold
  per ton at a yearly rate of 112,000 tonnes for a mine life of
  4.25 years.
      Possible reserves of 75,000 tonnes grading 0.38 ounce gold
  per ton at the break zone would extend mine life by a year,
  with considerable potential for development of further oxide
  ore reserves at the deposit, they said.
  

PEGASUS GOLD &lt;PGULF> STARTS MILLING IN MONTANA
  Pegasus Gold Inc said
  milling operations have started at its Montana Tunnels open-pit
  gold, silver, zinc and lead mine near Helena.
      The start-up is three months ahead of schedule and six mln
  dlrs under budget, the company said. Original capital cost of
  the mine was 57.5 mln dlrs, but came in at 51.5 mln dlrs, the
  company said.
      After a start-up period, the mill is expected to produce 
  106,000 ounces of gold, 1,700,000 ounces of silver, 26,000 tons
  of zinc and 5,700 tons of lead on an annual basis from
  4,300,000 tons of ore, the company said.
  

TALKING POINT/GOLD
  The price of gold bullion and share
  prices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from
  continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said.
      "There's been a tug of war between the (currency)
  speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it
  looks like the game has gone to the speculators," said John Ing
  at Maison Placements Canada Inc.
      The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today
  against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central
  banks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said.
      A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the
  traditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted.
      Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd,
  noted that "a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars.
  If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold."
      A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing
  said, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a
  four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct.
      Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its
  current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an
  average price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael
  Pickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs,
  with a possible spike above 500 dlrs.
      However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far
  faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself,
  causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere
  in the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign
  the buying pressure is slowing down. "The stocks have run an
  incredible way," Cohen said.
      On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd &lt;ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2,
  Campbell Red Lake Mines &lt;CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold
  &lt;NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4.
      The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268
  points at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC
  Minerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at
  43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18.
      Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct
  since December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has
  increased six pct. "Canadian golds have been the top performing
  index this year," he noted.
      In the U.S., there is "too much money chasing too few
  stocks," Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as
  pension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash,
  he added.
      Cohen also noted that today's silver price break through
  six dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the
  precious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold
  and silver prices to narrow.
  

PERU SAYS NEW GOLD DEPOSITS WORTH 1.3 BILLION DLRS
  President Alan Garcia said Peru has found
  gold deposits worth an estimated 1.3 billion dlrs in a jungle
  region near the Ecuadorean border about 1,000 km north of here.
      He told reporters the deposits, located at four sites near
  the town of San Ignasio, contained the equivalent of 100 tonnes
  of gold.
      Garcia said the government would soon install a two mln dlr
  treatment plant at Tomaque. It will extract enough ore to
  provide an estimated 25 mln dlr profit by the end of this year,
  he added.
      Garcia said the other gold-bearing deposits are located at
  Tamborapa, Pachapidiana and a zone between the Cenepa and
  Santiago rivers.
  

LAC &lt;LAC> INTERSECTS MORE GOLD AT DOYON MINE
  Lac Minerals Ltd and &lt;Cambior Inc> said
  they completed a second hole at their jointly owned Doyon mine
  in Quebec, which showed two significant gold intersections.
      One intersection graded 0.33 ounce gold a short ton over 44
  feet at depth of 1,411 feet, while the other graded 0.22 ounce
  gold a ton over 23 feet at 2,064 feet, the companies said. The
  hole is 460 feet east of the previously reported first hole.
      They said they were now drilling another hole 460 feet to
  the west of the first drill hole and expected to report results
  in late March or early April.
  

PERU ANNOUNCES LARGE NEW GOLD FIND
  President Alan Garcia said Peru has found
  gold deposits worth an estimated 1.3 billion dlrs in a jungle
  region near the Ecuadorean border about 1,000 km north of here.
      He told reporters yesterday the deposits, located at four
  sites near the town of San Ignasio, contained the equivalent of
  100 tonnes of gold.
      Garcia said the government would soon install a two mln dlr
  treatment plant at Tomaque. It will extract enough ore to

MORE GOLD DETECTED AT DOYON MINE
  Lac Minerals Ltd and Cambior Inc said
  they completed a second hole at their jointly owned Doyon mine
  in Quebec, which showed two significant gold intersections.
      One intersection graded 0.33 ounce gold per short ton over
  44 feet at depth of 1,411 feet, while the other graded 0.22
  ounce gold per ton over 23 feet at 2,064 feet, the companies
  said. The hole is 460 feet east of the previously reported
  first hole.
      Another hole is being drilled 460 feet to the west of the
  first drill hole and results are expected in late March or
  early April.
  

&lt;CORNUCOPIA RESOURCES LTD> IN DRILLING PROGRAM
  Cornucopia Resources Ltd said an
  extensive drill and sampling program will begin in mid-April at
  its Ivanhoe gold property in north central Nevada.
      It said it will seek to increase the present reserves of
  eight mln short tons grading 0.045 ounce of gold per ton that
  had been found by USX Corp &lt;X> on a small portion of the
  13,.000 acre property, determine the location of possible
  high-grade ore zones at depth and test other targets.
  

CITY RESOURCES &lt;CCIMF> TO SELL PROPERTY STAKE
  City Resources Ltd said it has agreed
  in principle to sell a 50 pct interest in a group of mineral
  properties in the southwest Pacific to a buyer it did not name
  for 30 mln Canadian dlrs.
      The company said a preliminary estimate of the geological
  resources of one of the properties to a depth of 200 meters
  indicates a potential of 1.2 mln ounces of gold, and by the
  middle of 1987 it expects to establish proven ore reserves
  containing at least 500,000 ounces of gold.  It said mining
  could start in 1988, subject to a satisfactory prefeasibility
  study.
      The company said completion of the transaction is subject
  to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
      City Resources is controlled by City Resources Ltd of
  Australia.
  

FED'S HELLER SEES RETURN TO SLOWER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH

  FED'S HELLER SEES RETURN TO SLOWER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH
  

FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER
  Robert Heller, a member of the
  Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of
  growth in the money supply this year.
      "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
  most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for
  delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,
  Calif.
      A text was released in Washington.
      He said the effect of lower inflation and financial
  deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
      "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
  levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed
  after mid-January.
      "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
  were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
  well," he added.
      Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
      "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to
  price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
  for our economic future," he said.
      Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
  import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces
  emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more
  market share for U.S. producers.
      "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
  the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.
      He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be
  disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy." 
      Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
  discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
  than new taxes.
      "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
  inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
  international markets," Heller said.
      He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct
  during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.
      A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
  Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American
  producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller
  said.
  

SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES
  The head of Spain's employers'
  federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried
  about the government's monetary policies because high real
  interest rates were hampering investment.
      He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
  year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
  target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by
  keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
      High real interest rates were attracting an influx of
  speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
  government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.
      Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
  liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
  pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a
  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
      To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
  11.8 at end-1986.
      Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
      These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
  workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
      He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
  pct wage ceiling.
      Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
  Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
  increase over the corresponding period last year.
      However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
  peseta to correct the imbalance.
  

NEW YORK BUSINESS LOANS FALL 1.31 BILLION DLRS
  Commercial and industrial loans on the
  books of the 10 major New York banks, excluding acceptances,
  fell 1.31 billion dlrs to 62.70 billion in the week ended April
  1, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said.
      Including acceptances, loans dropped 1.34 billion dlrs to
  63.23 billion.
      Commercial paper outstanding nationally fell 4.80 billion
  dlrs to 334.28 billion.
      National business loan data are scheduled to be released on
  Friday.
  

N.Y. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 169 MLN DLRS
  The eight major New York City banks had
  daily average borrowings of 169 mln dlrs from the Federal
  Reserve in the week ended April 8, a Fed spokesman said.
      A Fed spokesman said that all of the borrowings were made
  yesterday by fewer than half the banks.
      It was the second half of the two-week bank statement
  period that ended on Wednesday. Average borrowings by these
  banks were 142 mln dlrs in the first week of the period.

  U.S. BANK NET FREE RESERVES 447 MLN DLRS IN TWO WEEKS TO APRIL 8
  

U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 361 MLN DLRS
  U.S. bank discount window borrowings
  less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week
  to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said.
      Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591
  mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln
  dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement
  period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln
  dlrs in the first week of the period.
      Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on
  April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of
  447 mln dlrs.
      A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no
  large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in
  the week ended Wednesday.
      Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for
  65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when
  net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a
  high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90
  pct of the borrowing.
      Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a
  day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.
      Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between
  one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday.
      The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in
  holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems.
      About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected
  non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve
  bank.
      As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday,
  when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were
  corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction
  was made to unposted funds at a single bank.
      In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday,
  banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week
  but ran a deficit on Wednesday.
      In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday
  and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days.
  

U.S. M-1 MONEY SUPPLY FALLS TWO BILLION DLRS
  U.S. M-1 money supply fell two billion
  dlrs to a seasonally adjusted 738.9 billion dlrs in the March
  30 week, the Federal Reserve said.
      The previous week's M-1 level was revised to 740.9 billion
  dlrs from 741.0 billion, while the four-week moving average of
  M-1 rose to 739.8 billion dlrs from 739.7 billion.
      Economists polled by Reuters said that M-1 would be
  anywhere from down two billion dlrs to up 1.8 billion.
  

ASSETS OF U.S. MONEY FUNDS ROSE IN WEEK
  Assets of money market mutual funds
  increased 1.39 billion dlrs in the week ended yesterday to
  236.77 billion dlrs, the Investment Company Institute said.
      Assets of 93 institutional funds were up 481.1 mln dlrs to
  65.65 billion dlrs, 93 broker-dealer funds rose 285.3 mln dlrs
  to 107.31 billion dlrs, and 197 general purpose funds gained
  625.5 mln dlrs to 63.8 billion dlrs.
  

N.Z. TRADING BANK DEPOSIT GROWTH EASES SLIGHTLY
  New Zealand's trading bank

      Year-on-year total deposits rose 28.9 pct compared with a
  30.6 pct rise in January and 34.4 pct rise in February a year
  ago period, the bank said in its weekly statistical release.
      Total deposits rose to 17.55 billion N.Z. Dlrs in February
  compared with 17.18 billion in January and 13.61 billion in
  February 1986.
  

INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIALS TOO SMALL, BANKER SAYS
  Swiss National Bank President Pierre
  Languetin said a wider interest rate differential between the
  dollar and stronger currencies was needed to brake the dollar's
  fall.
      At a news conference, he said Japan and West Germany could
  try to stimulate their economies further by expanding money
  supply, but he added "I'm not so sure it would be desirable if
  monetary policy became more expansive.
      "But what would be useful is a greater differential in
  interest rates," he said.
  

SWISS SIGHT DEPOSITS FALL 4.64 BILLION FRANCS
  Sight deposits of commercial banks at
  the Swiss National Bank fell 4.64 billion Swiss francs to 7.88
  billion in the first 10 days of April, the National Bank said.
      Foreign exchange reserves rose by 9.4 mln francs to 33.12
  billion.
      Sight deposits are an important measure of money market
  liquidity in Switzerland.
      The National Bank said banks repaid around 5.8 billion
  francs of traditional central bank credit taken out to meet
  their end-of-quarter liquidity requirements. This was partially
  offset by new swap arrangements.
      Bank notes in circulation fell 440.2 mln francs to 24.48
  billion while other deposits on call at the National Bank --
  mainly government funds -- fell 840.5 mln francs to 941.5 mln.
  

GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY
  Four of West Germany's five leading
  economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
  growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
      But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,
  echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said
  the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
  necessarily threaten stability.
      The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
  three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
  GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.
      The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
  view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has
  shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
  rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
      Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may
  seem exaggerated, they said.
      "But it has often turned out in the past that the price
  climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
  a restrictive policy," they said.
      The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
  less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
      The four institutes disputed the view that monetary
  expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
  investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
  investments following lower interest rates.
      "Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
  central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
  smaller expansion of money supply," they said.
      A return to growth and stability did not require
  spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
  open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
  an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
      The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be
  focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of
  uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
  weakness other factors should be taken into account.
      Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
  and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
  speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
  in itself to price stability.
      The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
  reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
  falling mark.
  

SPANISH MONEY SUPPLY GROWING AT DOUBLE TARGET PACE
  Spain's principal measure of money
  supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP),
  grew at an annualised rate of 17.6 pct in March against 16.6
  pct in February and 19.6 pct in March last year, provisional
  Bank of Spain figures show.
      The bank's target range for this year is 6.5 to 9.5 pct,
  and Bank of Spain Governor Mariano Rubio said this month he was
  aiming for the lower end of that range.
      ALP grew by 11.4 pct during 1986.
  

TREASURY BALANCES AT FED FELL ON APRIL 9
  Treasury balances at the Federal
  Reserve fell on April 10 to 3.373 billion dlrs from 3.523
  billion dlrs on the previous business day, the Treasury said in
  its latest budget statement.
      Balances in tax and loan note accounts fell to 11.645
  billion dlrs from 11.869 billion dlrs on the same respective
  days.
      The Treasury's operating cash balance totaled 15.018
  billion dlrs compared with 15.392 billion dlrs on April 9.
  

JAPAN MARCH MONEY SUPPLY RISES 9.0 PCT
  Japan's broadly defined money supply
  average of M-2 plus certificate of deposits (CD) rose a
  preliminary 9.0 pct in March from a year earlier, compared with
  an 8.8 pct rise in February, the Bank of Japan said.
      The seasonally adjusted March average of M-2 plus CDs rose
  0.8 pct from February when it rose an identical 0.8 pct from a
  month earlier, it said.
      Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs stood at an average 343,600 billion
  yen in March compared with 336,015 billion in February.
  

JAPAN SEES HIGHER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH THIS QUARTER
  The Bank of Japan said it forecast
  Japan's broadly-defined M-2 money supply average plus
  certificates of deposit (CDs) will rise by about nine pct in
  the current April-June quarter against 8.5 pct a year earlier.
      Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in
  January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year
  earlier, it said.
      The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in
  floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift
  to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billion
  yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.
  

U.S. BUSINESS LOANS FALL 1.08 BILLION DLRS
  Business loans on the books of major
  U.S. banks, excluding acceptances, fell 1.08 billion dlrs to
  276.37 billion dlrs in the week ended April 8, the Federal
  Reserve Board said.
      The Fed said that business loans including acceptances fell
  1.1 billion dlrs to 278.67 billion dlrs.
  

FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY
  U.S. banking data released today are
  too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
  policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
  Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
  economists said.
      "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount
  window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate
  average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
  with a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago
  Corp.
      Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
  the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
      Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were
  935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
  statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
  December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
      Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
  dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this
  year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the
  Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
  reserves than the Fed had anticipated.
      However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed
  is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
  witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have
  forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
      First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week
  ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
  partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
  proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
  pay annual income taxes.
      As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
  reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.
      Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
  dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists
  said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
  projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
  add reserves too late.
      Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently
  left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which
  to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists
  said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
  outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add
  even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
      "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as
  much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"
  said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.
      McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting
  discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
  equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
      After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not
  tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
  economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging 
  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
  statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
      Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that
  the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's
  figures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving
  toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."
      Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
  pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
  unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
      Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political
  opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
  when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
  reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.
  

AUSTRALIA'S M-3 MONEY SUPPLY RISE 1.5 PCT IN MARCH
  Australia's M-3 money supply growth was
  1.5 pct in March and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to March, the
  Reserve Bank said.
      This compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in February
  and 11.1 pct in the year to end-February.
      The Reserve Bank said the M-3 data for March was affected
  by the start of the operations of &lt;National Mutual Royal
  Savings Bank Ltd>, which has resulted in the transfer of
  deposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the United
  Permanent Building Society to National Mutual Royal Savings
  Bank Ltd.
      The Reserve Bank said M-3 money supply in March was 110.77
  billion Australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion
  in February and 99.48 billion in March, 1986.
      M-3 is deposits of the private sector held by trading and
  savings banks plus holdings of notes and coins.
  

JAPAN DOES NOT INTEND TO EASE CREDIT - OFFICIALS
  The Bank of Japan does not intend to ease
  credit policy further, bank officials told Reuters.
      They were responding to rumours in the Japanese bond market
  that the central bank was planning to cut its 2.5 pct discount
  rate soon, possibly before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
  leaves for Washington on April 29.
      Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita will be in Osaka,
  western Japan on April 27 and 28 for the annual meeting of the
  Asian Development Bank, making a rate cut announcement early
  next week a virtual impossibility, they said. April 29 is a
  holiday here.
  

SOUTH AFRICAN M-3 APRIL GROWTH REVISED UPWARD
  South African year-on-year broadly
  defined M-3 money supply growth was revised upward to 10.37 pct
  for April from a preliminary 10.08 pct, but was down from a
  revised 10.69 pct in March, Reserve Bank figures show.
      M-3 rose to a revised 82.38 billion rand in April from a
  preliminary 82.17 billion and March's revised 81.39 billion. In
  April last year M-3 stood at 74.64 billion rand.
      Preliminary figures for May show M-3 at 83.24 billion rand
  for a year-on-year rise of 10.97 pct from 75.01 billion in May
  1986.
      April M-1A rose a year-on-year 15.12 pct to 14.22 billion
  rand after rising 14.72 pct to 13.97 billion in March while M1

FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY
  New U.S. Banking data suggest the
  Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
  and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
  said.
      But they also said that if money supply growth remains
  weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
  suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
  credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
  policy.
      A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
  forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
  8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
  decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
  to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
      Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
  the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
  fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
  economists said.
      "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said Bill Sullivan
  of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
      While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
  economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
  the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
  in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
  as better gauges of economic growth.
      Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
  measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
      If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
  concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
  could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
      "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
  market position? No," Sullivan said. "But does this mean the end
  of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."
      Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
  of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
  were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
  targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
      But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
  net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
  borrowings target would probably have been reached.
      A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
  auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
  while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
  helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
      "If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
  easing at some point," he said.
      Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
  attention to weak money supply growth. "It has been a number of
  years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
  economy," one said. "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
  falling apart and the Fed should ease."
      Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
  prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
  policy.
      They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
  for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
  higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
  off econmomic growth.
      But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
  April. "The Fed has to determine if this represents a
  fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
  them more room to ease," he said.
