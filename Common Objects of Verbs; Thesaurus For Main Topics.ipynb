      "## 1. Common Objects of Verbs ##\n",
      "The Church and Hanks reading shows how interesting semantics can be found by looking at very simple patterns. For instance, if we look at what gets drunk (the object of the verb drink) we can automatically acquire a list of beverages. Similarly, if we find an informative verb in a text about mythology, and look at the subjects of certain verbs, we might be able to group all the gods' names together by seeing who does the blessing and smoting.\n",
      "More generally, looking at common objects of verbs, or in some cases, subjects of verbs, we have another piece of evidence for grouping similar words together.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Find frequent verbs:** Using your tagged collection from the previous assignment, first pull out verbs and then rank by frequency (if you like, you might use WordNet's morphy() to normalize them into their lemma form, but this is not required). Print out the top 40 most frequent verbs and take a look at them:"
